  "A background job re-sent welcome emails because the cron expression used UTC while the app server was in local time. The job checked for 'created_at > 24.hours.ago' but ran twice after daylight savings, sending duplicates to hundreds of users. Marketing flagged the duplicates before anyone noticed the underlying time-zone mismatch.",
  "Pagination broke on the users list after adding an ORDER BY on a non-unique column. The frontend requested page=2 expecting new results, but since multiple rows had the same created_at timestamp, some users appeared twice while others vanished from later pages.",
  "A new feature flag was checked with if ENV['FEATURE_ENABLED'] instead of if ENV['FEATURE_ENABLED'] == 'true'. Production’s environment variables were all strings, so the feature was always considered on, even when set to 'false'. QA only caught it after seeing the feature live in staging unexpectedly.",
  "Form submissions began timing out because an after_save callback made an external HTTP request without a timeout. When the downstream service hung, web threads piled up, leading to a slow brownout across the app. Restarting the web workers temporarily cleared it.",
  "A background worker retried failed jobs instantly without delay. One bad input caused a job to fail 1000 times in a minute, spamming logs and saturating Redis connections. The error rate alert fired but no one could tell which job caused the storm until they inspected retry counts.",
  "An N+1 query appeared after adding a 'user.profile.name' field to an API response serializer. Each request made one main query plus one per user, exploding DB load when listing 500 users. A single index page now took seconds to render instead of milliseconds.",
  "A batch job that recalculated user balances used floating-point math instead of decimals. Rounding errors caused minor discrepancies that support had to manually adjust. The fix was just using integer cents instead of floats.",
  "An image upload endpoint accepted any file extension and wrote directly to S3. Users uploaded .exe and .zip files. The CDN started serving them with incorrect Content-Type headers, triggering corporate security scanners to flag the site.",
  "A simple counter metric (signup_count++) was written from multiple web nodes without atomic operations. Under load, increments were lost, and the number lagged behind reality. Analytics reports started showing impossible negative deltas.",
  "The contact form started throwing 500s after a schema migration removed a column used by a hidden field. Local dev had the column cached in memory, so the bug only appeared in production.",
  "Emails stopped sending because the SMTP password rotated in the environment but Sidekiq workers hadn’t been restarted. The queue filled silently while web requests kept working fine, hiding the failure for hours.",
  "A deploy added a new before_action that assumed all requests were authenticated. Health check endpoints started returning 401s, causing the load balancer to drain healthy nodes.",
  "The app’s background job queue slowed dramatically because a job added sleep(1) for rate-limiting an API call, but the rate limit was per worker, not per process. As a result, the whole pool idled unnecessarily.",
  "Static assets started returning 404 after a deploy that changed the asset digest format. Browser caches held references to old filenames that no longer existed on disk. Clearing the CDN cache fixed it but required coordination.",
  "A simple JSON endpoint started returning HTML error pages after a refactor moved error handling into a shared controller concern that rendered templates by default. Frontend parsing failed with 'Unexpected token <'.",
  "A query used .count instead of .size on a relation with includes(:comments). It triggered a separate COUNT(*) query, bypassing eager loading. Under heavy traffic, DB connections maxed out unexpectedly.",
  "A Redis cache key forgot to include the current user ID. Users began seeing each other’s preferences until the key pattern was fixed to include user.id.",
  "A CSV export feature wrote to /tmp but didn’t clean up after itself. The ephemeral disk filled up after a few days, causing random 500s across unrelated endpoints.",
  "Search results started missing new records because the background indexer crashed silently after an unhandled exception. Since the search UI cached empty results, the missing data persisted until someone manually reindexed.",
  "A webhook receiver didn’t verify signatures and accepted all incoming POSTs. A spammer discovered it and started sending garbage payloads, filling up logs and retry queues.",
  "An environment variable for API_URL had a trailing slash added in staging but not production. When concatenated with '/v1/users', staging returned 404s while prod worked fine. It took an hour to notice the double-slash issue.",
  "Users started reporting they couldn’t log out. The logout endpoint cleared the browser cookie but didn’t invalidate the server session token. Refreshing the page just reissued a session from the old cookie value.",
  "A feature rolled out gradually using 'if rand < 0.1' in the request cycle, but the random generator wasn’t seeded per request. The first 10% of requests after each deploy got the feature, and everyone else never saw it until next restart.",
  "An async job used the current timestamp as a unique ID. Two workers started at the same millisecond and overwrote each other’s records. It only happened under load tests, not locally.",
  "An HTTP client retried POST requests automatically after a timeout, causing duplicate payments in a sandbox environment. No idempotency keys were used, so test transactions showed up doubled in the admin UI."
