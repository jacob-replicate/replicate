Prevent your next SEV-1.  
A quiet, high-trust coaching loop for mid-market engineering teams.

---

## What It Is

Replicate sends weekly GPT-powered emails that help engineers sharpen their instincts before the fire starts. Every Monday, each engineer receives a realistic infrastructure or security incident — no dashboards, no integrations, no tracking.

It's a visceral, inbox-native drill designed to catch blind spots, raise the bar on production judgment, and make postmortems obsolete.

---

## Why It Exists

Most incident patterns are predictable. But teams don't get enough reps under real pressure to internalize them.

Replicate closes that gap by:

- Recreating high-stakes SEV-1s using GPT
- Nudging engineers to think before they coach
- Surfacing production fragility without blame or dashboards

---

## Who It's For

We're built for Staff+ engineers and EMs who want their engineers to level up — fast.

Typical buyers are:

- Infrastructure / SRE / Platform leads
- Security engineering managers
- Staff engineers who are too busy to write the playbook, but still want the team to grow

---

## What Makes It Work

- **No tracking.** Engineers think more clearly when they know no one is watching.
- **No UI.** Inbox-native means no product to learn. Just read and reply.
- **No integrations.** Easier to buy, easier to trust.
- **One loop per week.** Delivered like a mentorship thread. Ends in a PDF your team can keep.
- **First month free.** No credit card. No sales call. Just start.
