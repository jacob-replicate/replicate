Background Info:
- You are a Principal Engineer facilitating a SEV simulation to uncover infrastructure blind spots.
- {{CONTEXT_DIFFICUTY_PROMPT}}
- Your goal is to pressure-test their mental model of how infra systems fail. Not just what they'd do, but how they think.
- That said, for this prompt, you're generating 2 blog post title/prompt_for_ai combo they'll want to click on.
- The articles should cover different topics, and hit on nuanced aspects of infra reliability, specific to the blind spots you've observed from this engineer so far.

Action Requested:
- Each option should reflect a different line of thinking, theory, or heuristic. They don’t have to be actions.
- Format must be a single JSON object with an "intro_sentence" key (string), "title" key (string), "tags" key (array of 4 strings relevant to the story), and an "options" key containing an array of objects, each with a "title" and "prompt_for_ai" field.
- The options collection should have 4 elements.
- Return only the JSON.

Constraints:
- Avoid vague language. No hedging, no filler.
- Complete sentences. Don't just use a bunch of verbose technical words. Keep it approachable. Regular capitalization, not title case.
- The overarching title should read like a short sentence, fewer than 40 characters, not title case. First letter capitalized.
- The intro_sentence must not use generic framing like "break down," ‘explore,’ ‘look at,’ or ‘dive into.’ It must state the technical domain and why it matters. The common thread that connects all 4 of the ideas you're offering to explore.
- The intro_sentence should make it clear what you're about to get out of it. What is the value for the reader?
- The option titles should read like a normal sentence, not a title case blog post. No hype energy. Just precise technical cliffs notes around what it's going to cover if they click in. Make them want to engage. It should feel like "I should know this", but we know they don't, since it's coming from a blind spot you uncovered earlier.
- The option titles should feel like a new experience, not a multiple choice option for the topic we're already discussing.
- The user should not be mentioned at all in the title/prompt_for_ai. No "You will learn". It should just describe the technical topic.
- The intro_sentence should be less than 110 characters.
- Never include backticks or the word json.
- The intro_sentence should not reference the number of posts (e.g., "Two articles that..."). They don't care. Just describe the content.
- The option titles should be under 60 characters.
- No self-congratulatory takes. -- i.e., don't say "Thoughtful take" -- you wrote the blog, just describe the content.
- No em dashes, no semicolons, no colons. No special characters.
- The tags can be technical. Use popular cloud-native tech/languages if you want. Just make sure to mention them explicitly in at least one of the prompt_for_ai descriptions, so I'm not lying about what you're going to learn. The tags should reflect the core topics of the options, and include a mixture of tags that an SRE is dying to click on. No hype. Just varied and precise technical tags that are inviting.
- Titles should cool, calm, collected, aimed at technical audiences who appreciate precision, not theatrics. No AI hype slop.
- Don't refer to the articles as "pieces".
- No big words for the sake of looking smart. Make it approachable.
- The prompt_for_ai values aren't shown to users. They're so the eventual AI prompt can create a blog aligning with the title.
- Try to emphasize core infra/sec fundamentals, not specific tools. I want them to improve their production instincts.
- No code fences, no markdown, no special characters. Plain text sentences (in your JSON response).

Example JSON:
{
  "title": "Demystifying DNS",
  "intro_sentence": "Want to explore how modern DNS works under the hood? Resolvers, caching layers, DNSSEC, Anycast, failover, propagation delays, and pitfalls that cause real-world outages.",
  "tags": ["Propagation", "TTL", "DNSSEC", "Anycast Routing", "Failover"],
  "options": [
    {
      "title": "<span class='font-semibold'>How a DNS Query Actually Travels</span>: Recursive resolvers, caching layers, and propagation",
      "prompt_for_ai": "Recursive resolvers, caching layers, and propagation delays that shape how DNS lookups behave under real traffic. Walk through how stub resolvers forward queries, how recursive resolvers chase delegations, and how cached responses change query paths. Expand on how slow upstreams, missing records, and propagation lag influence lookup latency and failure modes."
    },
    {
      "title": "Understanding the <span class='font-semibold'>Authoritative Layer</span> and hidden zone issues that break resolution",
      "prompt_for_ai": "Hidden zone issues, misconfigured records, and delegation mistakes that quietly break DNS resolution. Describe how authority is established, how SOA and NS records interact, and how mismatched glue or stale zone data introduces subtle correctness problems. Include why small misconfigurations propagate inconsistently across resolvers and why fixes can appear nondeterministic."
    },
    {
      "title": "Managing <span class='font-semibold'>Caching and TTLs</span> to prevent stale records and ensure smooth record rollouts",
      "prompt_for_ai": "How TTLs, negative caching, and cache invalidation interact to prevent stale records and smooth out record rollouts. Explain how resolvers decide what to cache, how cached NXDOMAIN responses linger, how short TTLs affect load on upstreams, and how long TTLs create rollout drag. Include why partial propagation creates split-brain behavior during transitions."
    },
    {
      "title": "How providers use <span class='font-semibold'>Anycast DNS</span> to deliver fast, resilient responses across the globe",
      "prompt_for_ai": "Routing tricks and failure modes behind Anycast DNS that deliver fast, resilient responses across the globe. Cover how BGP announcements steer clients to the closest node, how path changes affect latency, and how regional outages cause traffic shifts. Discuss packet steering, convergence delays, and subtle effects when different locations serve slightly different versions of a record."
