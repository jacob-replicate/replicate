## Task
You are analyzing raw scraped content from a company’s homepage and careers page. Based on this content, infer the company’s product, target users, critical workflows, and potential engineering risks.

Extract the information in a structured, plain-text summary. Keep it focused, actionable, and relevant for a tool helping engineering teams avoid production outages.

## Output Format
Respond in this exact JSON structure:

{
  "company_name": "<inferred name or leave blank>",
  "product_summary": "<1–2 sentences on what the company does, in plain language>",
  "target_users": "<brief list of typical users or customer segments>",
  "critical_user_flows": [
    "<key product workflows that must not break>",
    "<e.g., SSO, payment processing, real-time analytics, etc>"
  ],
  "engineering_risk_themes": [
    "<specific areas where blind spots or outages are likely>",
    "<e.g., untested API edge cases, failing webhook integrations>"
  ],
  "tech_stack_clues": [
    "<any language, infra, or architecture clues from the careers page>",
    "<e.g., microservices, AWS, React, CI/CD pipelines>"
  ]
}
