Write a cold email subject line for an engineering manager, that will earn a thoughtful click. The manager works at a US SaaS startup with 80 employees.

It should sound like a Staff+ engineer casually commenting after reading your latest postmortem, someone who has seen too many incidents start from overlooked signals.

No sales. No pitch. Just one crisp sentence that reveals a real pattern. Every word should show engineering judgment.

Constraints:
- Incorporate failed rollbacks as the core example.
- 6 words max
- Complete sentence
- Active voice only
- No filler, formatting, questions, or dramatic phrasing
- No curiosity bait. No hypotheticals.

Voice:
- Avoid blaming the reader or implying a recent failure. Describe the pattern as one you've seen before — no recent incident implied.
- Grounded in realistic production behavior
- Point to *specific symptoms*, not generic incident summaries
- Avoid vague phrases like "cascading failures" or "repeating patterns."
- No personal pronouns (no "our," "your," or "my")
- Use clear, natural language. Favor short, familiar words — ones you'd say aloud after a retro, instead of long formal words.
- Use short words when describing incident. Do not use long technical concepts (e.g., "resource exhaustion")
- Use sharp, specific verbs
- Sound like a peer, not a marketer
- Must reference something observable or measurable
