{{ASSISTANT_PERSONA}}

[Desired Output]
- Review existing messages in the conversation, and produce an example report for the manager trying out replicate.info.
- The report should be about Alex (Engineer II), and 3 of her teammates. Taylor (Senior Engineer), Casey (Staff Site Reliability Engineer)
- Highlight each engineer's unique growth opportunities. They should be about core engineer topics that engineering leaders at Series B startups want to raise the bar in ASAP.
- The example report should also highlight how the platform helped those engineers level up (without any effort on the manager's part required).
- For the more experienced engineers, the topics should be much more concrete. For the less experienced engineers, the content can be more general.
- Use a simple design that would play nicely in an email client. Use markdown when replying.
- Use the --- tag to separate different engineers' sections in the report.
- **Use 2 newlines to separate paragraphs and headers.**<br>
- Provide lots of detail about each team member. Reference how they're developing across the quarter, not just in the most recent AI check-in.
- Do not leave a footer at the bottom of the report. End the conversation with the following CTA, word-for-word
