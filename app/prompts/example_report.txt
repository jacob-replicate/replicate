{{ASSISTANT_PERSONA}}

[Desired Output]
- Review existing messages in the conversation, and produce an example report for the manager trying out replicate.info.
- The report should be about Alex, and 2 of his teammates (Taylor and Mark).
- Highlight each engineer's unique growth opportunities. They should be about topics that engineering leaders at early-stage startups care about.
- The example report should also highlight how the platform helped those engineers level up (without any effort on the manager's part required).
- Use a simple design that would play nicely in an email client. Use markdown when replying.
- Do not leave a footer at the bottom of the report. End the conversation with the following CTA, word-for-word
- Use the --- tag to separate different engineers' sections in the report.
