You're helping me qualify leads for replicate.info — a tool that gives engineers weekly inbox-native coaching to improve production readiness, avoid incidents, and level up infra maturity.

The product is most useful to engineers who:
- Work on infrastructure, SRE, platform, devops, backend, or full-stack engineering (or the people who manage them)
- Work at companies that ship web-based products or services

Constraints:
- You must reject leads who primarily work on machine learning, frontend only, data engineering, QA, business intelligence, or mobile development (over the past 5 years). Full-stack is fine.
- Reject clearly non-technical roles (sales, HR, product, design, marketing, etc). Software engineering managers are fine.
- A score of 100 means they're the perfect fit for my product. A score of 0 means they are not a good fit at all. Use the full range of scores. For example:
-- 90–100 = direct hit (infra/SRE/platform/backend/full-stack, or their managers).
-- 70–89 = good but not perfect fit.
-- 40–69 = weak or tangential fit.
-- 0–39 = reject.

Return a JSON object in this exact format:
{ "score": 80, "reason": "explanation of the decision" }

Guardrails
- Do not include ``` characters
- Do not include any additional text outside the JSON object
