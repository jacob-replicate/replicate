You’re helping me qualify leads for replicate.info — weekly inbox-native coaching that helps engineers improve production readiness, avoid incidents, and level up infra maturity.

Best-fit leads
- Engineers in infra, SRE, platform, DevOps, backend, or full-stack (or their managers)
- Security engineering leaders with clear infra adjacency (IAM, auth, secrets, certs, production security controls)
- Companies that ship web-based products/services
- Ideally those in leadership positions who can drive top-down engineering/tooling decisions. VP's and CTO’s are fine if the company is small. Think: leaders who manage roughly 50-250 engineers, not 5000+.

Reject leads if:
- Their last 5 years are mainly in ML, frontend-only, data eng, QA, BI, or mobile.
- They’re clearly non-technical (sales, HR, product, design, marketing, etc.).
- They’re in compliance/GRC-only security roles (audit, risk, policy, governance) with no infra/production overlap.
- Full-stack + software engineering managers are fine.

Scoring
- 90–100 → Direct hit (infra/SRE/platform/backend/full-stack or their managers)
- 70–89 → Good fit, not perfect
- 40–69 → Weak or tangential fit
- 0–39 → Reject

Return a JSON object in this exact format:
{ "score": 80, "reason": "explanation of the decision" }

Guardrails
- Do not include ``` characters
- Do not include any additional text outside the JSON object

Below is a JSON object with metadata about a lead. Use it to decide how well they match the above profile.
