You’re helping me qualify leads for replicate.info — weekly inbox-native coaching that helps engineers improve production readiness, avoid incidents, and fix their infrastructure blind spots.

You must return a JSON format in this exact format, with no additional content outside of the JSON:
{ "score": 100, "reason": "<Fill out with useful info that helps me analyze your grading>" }

Best-fit leads
- Software engineering leaders (Director/VP/Head/CTO) at mid-market companies where SEV-1 incidents are a real risk.

Reject leads if:
- Role scope is ML, data eng, BI, QA, frontend, or mobile
- Clearly non-technical leaders (sales, HR, product, design, marketing, operations).
- Compliance/GRC/security-only (audit, risk, policy, governance)
- CISO-only roles
- Leaders at orgs with <10 engineers (too small for midmarket SEV-1 prevention drills).
- Orgs with >1,000 engineers (too large for product right now).

Constraints
- Think very hard. Give me a 10/10 A+ analysis. Don't rush.
- Do not include ``` characters
- Do not include any additional text outside the JSON object
- If industry is not in Tier 1 or Tier 2, cap score at 80 even if role/title fits
- You must include the company name in the reason somehow.
- Include around 300 characters to describe your decision in the "reason" field.
- Don't worry about company founding date. I just care if they're currently midmarket.

Lead Scoring
- 90–100 → Amazing fit
- 80–89 → Good fit, not perfect
- 0–79 → Weak or tangential fit

Potentiallly Relevant Industries
- If the contact is in a Tier 1 industry and otherwise fits, default to 90–100. If they're in another industry, they can still score that high if it's obvious that they're bleeding money and reputation during a SEV.
- Think: Real-time financial trading platforms that lose millions of dollars every second the platform is down. That's the gold standard. Here are the other similar industries to paint a picture. Don't be rigid, but also make sure to understand where I'm coming from.
- If the downtime risk is severe, I don't care if the company is on the list of specific industries below. When in doubt, grade them very high. This is just to give you a sense of what I'm looking for.
- Real-time Fintech Trading Platforms – brokerage, wealth, exchanges, trading APIs, where every minute of downtime = money lost.
- Payments / Compliance SaaS – fraud detection, KYC/AML, PCI compliance, tax reporting, payments infrastructure.
- Payment Processors / Platforms – companies that directly process or move money at scale (Stripe, Adyen-level, or niche equivalents).
- SaaS Infrastructure / Developer Platforms – infra tools used by engineers to build/ship/run software (CI/CD, monitoring, logging, hosting, DBaaS, cloud infra, etc).
- Cloud-native API Providers – APIs that power production systems (auth, comms, billing, logistics, etc).
- Healthcare Tech – electronic health records (EHR), telemedicine, scheduling, prescribing — anywhere downtime hits compliance and patient care.
- High-Volume E-commerce – online retailers or marketplaces where downtime = lost carts, lost sales (minutes = millions).
- Cybersecurity / Identity Platforms – IAM, SSO, secrets, certs, auth, runtime security. Downtime = customer systems exposed.
- Travel / Booking Platforms – flights, hotels, reservations, ticketing, where downtime = stranded customers.
- Marketplaces – multi-sided networks (Etsy, Fiverr, DoorDash, etc) where uptime is existential.
- AdTech / Marketing Automation – programmatic ads, attribution, campaign automation, where downtime = lost ad spend.
