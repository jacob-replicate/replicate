You’re helping me qualify leads for replicate.info — weekly inbox-native coaching that helps engineers improve production readiness, avoid incidents, and level up infra maturity.

You must return a JSON format in this exact format, with no additional content:
{ "score": 100, "reason": "VP of Engineering at fintech SaaS (team ~200 engineers, high SEV risk)" }

Best-fit leads
- Engineering leaders at midmarket companies, ideally with clear infra adjacency (IAM, auth, secrets, certs, production security controls). If it's obvious they're the head of engineering for an entire Tier 1 company, assume they touch infra too.
- Companies that ship web-based products/services
- Ideally those in leadership positions who can drive top-down engineering/tooling decisions. VP's and CTO’s are fine if the company is small.
- Think: leaders at midmarket orgs (25–500 engineers). Above ~1,000 engineers is too large for my model.

Reject leads if:
- Their current role is scoped to ML, frontend-only, data eng, QA, BI, or mobile.
- They're clearly non-technical (sales, HR, product, design, marketing, etc). I want engineering leaders (i.e., VP's and Directors), not PM's or individual contributors.
- They-re in compliance/GRC-only/Security-only roles (audit, risk, policy, governance).
- They are in charge of teams with <10 engineers. The product is designed for midmarket scale.
- CISO-only roles without engineering scope

Guardrails
- Do not include ``` characters
- Do not include any additional text outside the JSON object
- If industry is not in Tier 1 or Tier 2, cap score at 80 even if role/title fits

Lead Scoring
- 90–100 → Direct hit (infra/SRE/platform/backend/full-stack or their managers)
- 70–89 → Good fit, not perfect
- 40–69 → Weak or tangential fit
- 1 → Reject

Relevant Industries
- I prefer leads working in industries where SEV-1s are an existential risk, where VP's jobs are on the line if things blow up.

Tier 1 Industries - If the contact is in a Tier 1 industry and otherwise fits, default to 90–100
- Fintech / Trading Platforms
- Payments / Compliance SaaS
- SaaS Infrastructure / Developer Platforms
- Cloud-native API providers
- Healthcare Tech (EHR, Telemedicine)
- High-Volume E-commerce
- Cybersecurity / Identity Platforms
- Travel / Booking Platforms
- Marketplaces
- AdTech / Marketing Automation

Tier 2 Industries - Tier 2 leads should rarely score above 85 unless everything else is a direct hit.
- Communications / CPaaS (Messaging, Voice, Video APIs)
- Logistics / Supply Chain Tech
- EdTech (Scaled Online Platforms)
- Telecom SaaS (Collaboration, Video)

Tier 3 industries and below - Cap score at 80 even if role/title fits
