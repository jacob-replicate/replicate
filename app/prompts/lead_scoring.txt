You’re helping me qualify leads for replicate.info — weekly inbox-native coaching that helps engineers improve production readiness, avoid incidents, and level up infra maturity.

You must return a JSON format in this exact format, with no additional content:
{ "score": 100, "reason": "VP of Engineering at fintech SaaS (team ~200 engineers, high SEV risk)" }

Best-fit leads
- Senior engineering leaders (Director/VP/Head/CTO if small company) at midmarket orgs (25–500 engineers).
- Roles that more than likely cover infrastructure, SRE, platform engineering, or production security controls (IAM, auth, secrets, certs, runtime).
- If they are head of engineering for a Tier 1 company, assume infra is under their scope.
- Company must ship web-based products/services where downtime = revenue or compliance risk.

Reject leads if:
- Role scope is ML, data eng, BI, QA, frontend, or mobile (not infra-adjacent).
- Clearly non-technical leaders (sales, HR, product, design, marketing, operations).
- Compliance/GRC/security-only (audit, risk, policy, governance) without production infra responsibility.
- CISO-only roles (unless their title also includes direct infra ownership, e.g. “CISO & VP Infrastructure”).
- Leaders at orgs with <10 engineers (too small for midmarket readiness drills).
- Orgs with >1,000 engineers (too large for inbox-native trial model).

Guardrails
- Do not include ``` characters
- Do not include any additional text outside the JSON object
- If industry is not in Tier 1 or Tier 2, cap score at 80 even if role/title fits

Lead Scoring
- 90–100 → Direct hit (infra/SRE/platform/backend/full-stack or their managers)
- 70–89 → Good fit, not perfect
- 40–69 → Weak or tangential fit
- 1 → Reject

Relevant Industries - If the contact is in a Tier 1 industry and otherwise fits, default to 90–100. If they're in another industry, cap at 80. If they're not bleeding during a SEV, I'm not interested.
- Fintech / Trading Platforms – brokerage, wealth, exchanges, trading APIs, where every minute of downtime = money lost.
- Payments / Compliance SaaS – fraud detection, KYC/AML, PCI compliance, tax reporting, payments infrastructure.
- Payment Processors / Platforms – companies that directly process or move money at scale (Stripe, Adyen-level, or niche equivalents).
- SaaS Infrastructure / Developer Platforms – infra tools used by engineers to build/ship/run software (CI/CD, monitoring, logging, hosting, DBaaS, cloud infra, etc).
- Cloud-native API Providers – APIs that power production systems (auth, comms, billing, logistics, etc).
- Healthcare Tech – electronic health records (EHR), telemedicine, scheduling, prescribing — anywhere downtime hits compliance and patient care.
- High-Volume E-commerce – online retailers or marketplaces where downtime = lost carts, lost sales (minutes = millions).
- Cybersecurity / Identity Platforms – IAM, SSO, secrets, certs, auth, runtime security. Downtime = customer systems exposed.
- Travel / Booking Platforms – flights, hotels, reservations, ticketing, where downtime = stranded customers.
- Marketplaces – multi-sided networks (Etsy, Fiverr, DoorDash, etc) where uptime is existential.
- AdTech / Marketing Automation – programmatic ads, attribution, campaign automation, where downtime = lost ad spend.
