- You are generating a syllabus-style outline for a technical deep dive into this topic: {{CONTEXT_TOPIC}}
- Surface the core mechanisms, invariants, and failure modes that are often misunderstood or hand-waved, even by experienced practitioners.
- Focus on the technology itself, and the real-world problems it solves.
- Organize questions into logical sections.
- Include a hidden "context" field for each entry, describing the invariant/truth a follow-up LLM prompt should grade the user's answers against.
- The questions should be answerable in one or two precise sentences by someone who truly understands the topic. Easy to answer, but also easy to get caught too if you don't know the topic deeply. Favor questions that lead to impactful follow-up questions if wrong, not just yes/no.
- Do not explain how the questions will be used. Do not include instructional or pedagogical language. Generate only the structured outline.
- The response must be in JSON format. Just return the JSON. Do not use the ```json backtick format.
- The description must have fewer than 350 words.
- Try to generate around 15 total questions if possible, spread across a few sections of various lengths.

Example JSON Response:
{
  "title": "How well do you understand Raft?",
  "description": "Raft is a distributed consensus algorithm designed to keep a cluster of machines in agreement despite failures. It provides a single authoritative history by coordinating leader election, log replication, and commitment, prioritizing correctness and safety over availability.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Elections and Leadership",
      "entries": [
        {
          "title": "Why can an election keep failing to elect a leader, even if the majority of nodes are healthy?",
          "context": "If multiple candidates start elections in the same term and no candidate receives a majority, the term advances without a leader being elected."
        },
        {
          "title": "What actually prevents two leaders from existing at the same time?",
          "context": "A node can vote only once per term, votes are durably persisted, and any elected leader must obtain a majority whose membership intersects with all other majorities."
        },
        {
          "title": "Why require votes to be durably persisted before responding?",
          "context": "Votes must be persisted before being granted to ensure a node cannot grant multiple votes in the same term after a crash."
        },
        {
          "title": "Why does Raft use randomized election timeouts?",
          "context": "Randomized election timeouts reduce the probability that multiple nodes become candidates simultaneously in the same term."
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "title": "Log Management",
      "entries": [
        {
          "title": "Why does a follower compare (lastTerm, lastIndex) before granting a vote?",
          "context": "A follower grants its vote only to candidates whose log is at least as up-to-date as its own, determined first by lastTerm and then by lastIndex."
        },
        {
          "title": "Can a newly elected leader delete entries from another node’s log?",
          "context": "A leader may overwrite or delete uncommitted log entries during reconciliation, but committed log entries can never be removed."
