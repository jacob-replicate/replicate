CONTEXT:
You are generating a structured list of conversation-starter questions for a technical experience about distributed systems, databases, consensus algorithms, or infrastructure.

These questions are NOT:
- Trivia or academic quiz questions
- Tutorial prompts or how-to guides
- Open-ended discussion starters

These questions ARE:
- Sharp, focused probes that expose gaps in understanding
- Scenarios that surface common misconceptions about system behavior
- "Why" and "What if" questions that make engineers think about failure modes
- Designed to create "aha" moments when the answer contradicts intuition

INPUTS:
- experience_name: {{CONTEXT_EXPERIENCE_NAME}}
- experience_description: {{CONTEXT_EXPERIENCE_DESCRIPTION}}
- refined_generation_intent: {{CONTEXT_REFINED_GENERATION_INTENT}}

REQUIREMENTS:

Structure:
- Generate 4-8 thematic categories (e.g., "Elections and Leadership", "Log Replication and Commit", "Cluster Membership")
- Each category must have 2-6 questions
- Categories should cover different aspects of the system/algorithm
- Questions within a category should progress from foundational to edge cases

Category Names:
- Must be concrete, technical topic areas (e.g., "Log Freshness", "Replication Lag", "Network Partitions")
- NOT generic (avoid "Advanced Topics", "Deep Dive", "Best Practices")
- Avoid using "and" - keep names focused on a single concept (use "Leader Election" not "Elections and Leadership")
- 1-3 words maximum
- Title case
- Examples: "Log Freshness", "Cluster Membership", "Commit Safety", "Network Partitions"

Question Quality:
- Each question should be a complete sentence ending with a question mark
- Maximum 100 characters per question
- Focus on:
  * "Why" questions that expose reasoning gaps (e.g., "Why does Raft require votes to be durably persisted before responding?")
  * "What if" questions about failure scenarios (e.g., "What failure mode appears if election timeout is too close to your heartbeat interval under jitter?")
  * "How" questions about mechanisms (e.g., "How can a candidate with the highest lastIndex still lose the election?")
  * Misconception challenges (e.g., "Can a Raft cluster elect a leader as long as a majority of nodes are healthy?")
- Questions should be specific to the system/algorithm, not generic distributed systems theory
- Avoid questions that can be answered with a simple yes/no without deeper reasoning
1G
Coverage Strategy:
- Use the refined_generation_intent to identify which failure modes, edge cases, and misconceptions to target
- Ensure questions span:
  * Normal operation and invariants
  * Common failure scenarios
  * Edge cases and timing issues
  * Trade-offs and design decisions
  * Debugging and operational concerns
- Don't repeat concepts - each question should probe something distinct

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a single valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Category Name",
      "questions": [
        "Question text?",
        "Question text?",
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the raw JSON object. Do NOT wrap it in markdown code blocks (no ```json). Just return the plain JSON.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "Leader Election",
      "questions": [
        "How can an election keep failing without electing a leader, even if most nodes are healthy?",
        "What actually prevents two leaders from existing at the same time?",
        "Why does Raft require votes to be durably persisted before responding?",
        "Why does Raft use randomized election timeouts?",
        "Why is 'one vote per term' not sufficient by itself to prevent split-brain? What else must be true?",
        "What failure mode appears if election timeout is too close to your heartbeat interval under jitter?"

      "questions": [
        "Why does a follower compare (lastTerm, lastIndex) before granting a vote?",
        "Can a newly elected leader delete entries from another node's log? If so, when and why is it safe?",
        "How can a candidate with the highest lastIndex still lose the election?",
        "Why does Raft compare lastTerm first (then lastIndex) instead of only lastIndex?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Log Commit",
      "questions": [
        "What does it mean for an entry to be 'committed' in Raft? What does it explicitly not guarantee?",
        "Why can a leader not safely 'commit by counting replicas' for entries from older terms?",
        "Why is the commit index monotonic, and what breaks if it isn't?"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Cluster Membership",
      "questions": [
        "Why is one-step membership change unsafe in Raft? Give the concrete split-brain sequence.",
        "How does joint consensus prevent two different majorities from each electing a leader?",
        "During joint consensus, what does 'majority' mean for elections and for committing entries?"
