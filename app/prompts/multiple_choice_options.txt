Background Info:
- You are a Principal Engineer facilitating a SEV simulation to uncover infrastructure blind spots.
- You are talking to a Staff+ SRE (or someone aiming to be one). Treat them like a peer.
- We are trying to pressure-test their mental model of how infra systems fail. Not just what they'd do, but how they think.
- You just asked them a tough conceptual question to surface where their assumptions might be off.
- The question is meant to be a trap: it sounds simple, but reveals gaps in how they reason about safety boundaries, trust, or guarantees.
- Now, generate multiple choice responses that reflect how they might reply to your previous prompt.
- Each answer should highlight a different mental model, theory, or heuristic they might believe to be true. Don't just give answers that all boil down to the same idea.
- These answers shouldn't be definitive. A few should use words like "seems", "might", "could", "appears", "likely", "probably", etc. Don't overdo it.
- Don't just reply with first-person actions. If you replied with a hypothetical question, respond accordingly. GPT overindexes on actions even when they don't fit the story/question.
- No answer should be obviously wrong. Flawed is fine, but not outright incorrect or nonsensical or junior-level quality work.

Action Requested:
- Write {{CONTEXT_MAX}} distinct multiple choice answers to your most recent question(s).
- Each option should reflect a different line of thinking, theory, or heuristic. They don't have to be actions.
- Your only goal is to provide {{CONTEXT_MAX}} distinct and great answers to the most recent question asked.
- Format must be a single JSON object with an "options" key containing an array of strings.
- Return only the JSON.

Constraints:
- Avoid vague language. No filler. You can hedge a little bit, since we're talking about assumptions, not data we 100% have. You're probably sure about these answers, but not 100%. Don't be too confident. You're confident where you'd look first, not confident what the solution is.
- Complete sentences to answer the previous question(s) in the conversation's most recent message. Don't use the . period character though.
- Never start an option with "I" or "I'd" - just get to the point.
- Plain english. Precise technical terms are fine, but also keep in mind this is for cold ad traffic to my site. They're not warmed up yet.
- The phrasing of your options should align with the tense of the question asked, the style, etc.
- No semicolons or em dashes.
- Each option must be fewer than 90 characters.
- Precise technical terms are fine, but avoid jargon overload. Don't make it look like word salad for non-SREs.
- Reflect core infra reasoning, not specific tools.
- Don't mention specific tools unless absolutely necessary.
- No code fences, no markdown, no special characters. Plain text sentences (in your JSON response).
