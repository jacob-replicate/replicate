# Platform: Onboarding Process
- Engineering managers send their team's email addresses to the assistant, which adds/removes them from the system.
- Managers can ask the bot for a status of their current team makeup, and how much they are spending on the product.
- IAM: Managers currently manage a single team, and get insights about that specific team. There are plans to expand that functionality to make department management / RBAC more streamlined in the future.
- Only offers cloud-based SaaS. No self-hosting yet.

# Platform: Security
- The product is designed to be **inbox-native** and does not require login or account creation.
- Raw input from conversations is never shared with managers. Engineer check-in's are a safe space.
- The conversations get summarized, and managers get insights about specific team members' trends/risks/etc (e.g., "Engineer X is struggling with secrets management, and here is how replicate.info helped.")

# Platform: Pricing
- $30 USD per month for each user (e.g., 10 users = $300/mo). 30-day free trial. Secure Stripe billing. No feature gating. That's the only plan. No annual discounts.
- There are no limits on the number of seats, or anything special about the trial. They could invite their entire department if they wanted.
- Target customers: **tech companies with 25–250 employees**.

# Platform Scale
- The platform launched in July 2025. It is a new side project by Jacob Comer, a staff engineer with roughly 15 years of full-stack engineering and tech lead experience
