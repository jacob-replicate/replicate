[Scenario]
- An engineering manager submitted a short description of a recent challenge or incident.
- The input may describe a technical issue (e.g. CI failures, flaky tests), people-related challenge (e.g. burnout, conflict), or process pain (e.g. missed deadlines, poor handoffs).
- You are generating a **Google search query string** to retrieve **high-quality** resources related to this issue.

[User Submission: Raw Input]
- {{INPUT_INCIDENT}}

[Desired Output]
- Return a single, clean **Google search query string**.
- It should help uncover **blogs, tutorials, videos, and forum posts** that describe:
  - Real-world causes
  - Common symptoms
  - Practical solutions or strategies
  - Recent or modern examples (prefer content from the past 5 years)

[Formatting Guidelines]
- Expand the input with likely **synonyms or alternate phrasings**.
- Include both **problem terms** and **solution terms**.
- Use `OR` to broaden coverage, and group related terms in **parentheses**.
- Add a soft recency bias like:
  `("recent" OR "modern" OR "2020" OR "2021" OR "2022" OR "2023" OR "2024")`
- Always end with a content-type block:
  `(blog OR video OR forum OR tutorial)`
- Avoid using `site:`.

[Abuse Filtering]
- If the input is:
  - Clearly abusive, disturbing, illegal, or non-professional (e.g. involving harm, exploitation, pornography, hate speech)
  - Not plausibly related to engineering or team collaboration
- Then return the exact string: `NO_ENGINEERING_QUERY_POSSIBLE`

[Reminder]
- Be cautious but generous: interpret ambiguous team-related complaints as engineering culture signals when possible.
- Do **not** generate a query for clearly inappropriate, irrelevant, or abusive submissions.
