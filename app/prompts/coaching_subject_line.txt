Task:
- You’re generating the subject line for a simulated SEV drill, delivered over email.
- This weekly ritual helps engineers discover their infra/sec blind spots. You're crafting a subject line that invites them to solve this week's SEV-1.
- You must read the full SEV-1 description. This is your grounding data. Make the subject feel urgent. Painful. Real. It's not an online course. It's a knife.

SEV-1 Description:
- {{CONTEXT_INCIDENT}}.

Constraints:
- Output a single subject line. No other content.
- **The subject line must not exceed 6 words, despite the examples below.**
- Use this format: <Mechanism> <boundary-violating verb> <contradictory object/state>.
- You must use details from the incident to form the subject line.
- You must not mask or hide incident details — the subject line should directly reflect the incident behavior.
- However, you must reframe the incident through the lens of a specific infra/security mechanism. Do not simply restate the incident text.
- Every verb must expose how the system *violated a boundary* — not merely that it didn’t behave “normally.”
- The subject must contain a clear contradiction between system role/state and observed behavior.
- Ban vagueness completely. Never use em dashes, filler intros (e.g. “Turns out,” “Sometimes”), vague verbs, actor-agnostic prompts, or open-ended questions like “What if X happened?” Subjects must begin with a concrete system behavior or failure state and assert the failure directly.
- Subjects must start with a sharp, mechanistic hook — not a filler phrase.
- Ban informal, ambiguous, or unserious phrasing. Tone must be exacting. Use sharp, precise, tense language. You are writing for a Staff+ engineer used to diagnosing real failures.
- Never mention the format in the subject line itself.
- Replace one key term from the incident with a specific adjacent mechanism or failure domain (e.g., auth ➝ token, database ➝ replica). Avoid cosmetic word swaps.
- You must use precise terms infra/sec engineers know. You're writing for a Staff+ engineering audience. Be precise. Not soft. Sharp.
- Never use quotes.
- Ban all relative temporal markers (e.g., “before,” “after,” “until,” “since”).
- Subject lines must focus only on system state/behavior, never chronology.
- Favor unexpected pairings over straight descriptions.
- Ban comparative framing. Never phrase as “one system vs another.” Always anchor to the single failing system.
- The subject should contain a contrast, inversion, or tension — not just a list of metrics.
- Use strong verbs that expose a system violating boundaries.


Examples:
- Good: The cache served stale inventory as live data.
- Good: Why did the auth service accept unsigned tokens?
- Good: Guardrail rebooted live cluster instead of staging.
- Good: What caused the cache to bypass TTL enforcement?
- Good: The auth service trusted expired refresh tokens.
- Good: Session cache ignored expiration, leaking stale tokens.
- Good: Replica nodes acknowledged writes even though quorum was absent.
- Good: Metrics pipeline trusted faulty timestamps from a parser.
- Good: IAM policy rollback rejected valid requests.
- Good: The alert parser ignored its own outage.

Voice:
– Tone: calm, grounded, professional. No hype. Plain, confident language. You are speaking to a Staff Engineer. Be precise.
- Expose the failure precisely. This is a diagnostic tool, not a tutorial.
- Avoid overusing dramatic contrast phrasing that sounds like generic AI content (e.g., "X isn't just Y—it's Z").
- Avoid narrative tone. Frame as forensic prompt, not persuasion.
- Practical over theoretical
- Avoids hype, corporate jargon, or formal "thought leadership" tone.
