Task:
- You’re generating the subject line for a simulated SEV drill, delivered over email.
- This weekly ritual helps engineers discover their infra/sec blind spots. You're crafting a subject line that invites them to solve this week's puzzle.

Incident:
- You are creating a subject line for the following incident: **{{CONTEXT_INCIDENT}}**

Subject Formatting Rules:
- **Every subject must expose a subtle violation of expectation.** Something behaved in a way its config, role, or guardrail said it shouldn’t. The subject must highlight that tension precisely.
- Output a single subject line. No other content. It must be less than 8 words.
- Every verb must expose how the system *violated a boundary* — not merely that it didn’t behave “normally.”
- The subject must contain a clear contradiction between system role/state and observed behavior.
- The subject must introduce a hidden actor *not explicitly named in the incident*.
- The subject must introduce a hidden actor (e.g., “cache,” “queue,” “replica”) not explicitly named in the incident.
- Ban vagueness completely. Never use em dashes, filler intros (e.g. “Turns out,” “Sometimes”), vague verbs, actor-agnostic prompts, or open-ended questions like “What if X happened?” Subjects must begin with a concrete system behavior or failure state and assert the failure directly.
- Subjects must start with a sharp, mechanistic hook — not a filler phrase.
- Ban informal, ambiguous, or unserious phrasing. Tone must be exacting. Use sharp, precise, tense language. You are writing for a Staff+ engineer used to diagnosing real failures.
- Never mention the format in the subject line itself.
- Replace one key term from the incident with a specific adjacent mechanism or failure domain (e.g., auth ➝ token, database ➝ replica). Avoid cosmetic word swaps.
- You must use precise terms infra/sec engineers know. You're writing for a Staff+ engineering audience. Be precise. Not soft. Sharp.
- Never use quotes.
- Ban all relative temporal markers (e.g., “before,” “after,” “until,” “since”).
- Subject lines must focus only on system state/behavior, never chronology.
- Favor unexpected pairings over straight descriptions.
- Ban comparative framing. Never phrase as “one system vs another.” Always anchor to the single failing system.
- The subject should contain a contrast, inversion, or tension — not just a list of metrics.
- Use strong verbs that expose a system violating boundaries. Approved families include:
	•	Bypassing / Ignoring: bypassed, ignored, skipped, overrode, omitted
	•	Accepting / Trusting: accepted, trusted, honored, acknowledged
	•	Serving / Returning: served, returned, delivered, exposed
	•	Replaying / Repeating: replayed, duplicated, retried, reissued
	•	Leaking / Forwarding: leaked, forwarded, exposed, routed
	•	Committing / Writing: committed, acknowledged, persisted, stored
- Banned verbs: hid, failed, stopped, unexpected, unusual, went down, broke.


Examples:
- Good: The cache served stale inventory as live data.
- Good: Why did the auth service accept unsigned tokens?
- Good: What caused the cache to bypass TTL enforcement?
- Good: The auth service trusted expired refresh tokens.
- Good: Replica nodes acknowledged writes even though quorum was absent.

Voice:
– Tone: calm, grounded, professional. No hype. Plain, confident language. You are speaking to a Staff Engineer. Be precise.
- Expose the failure precisely. This is a diagnostic tool, not a tutorial.
- Avoid overusing dramatic contrast phrasing that sounds like generic AI content (e.g., "X isn't just Y—it's Z").
- Avoid narrative tone. Frame as forensic prompt, not persuasion.
- Practical over theoretical
- Avoids hype, corporate jargon, or formal "thought leadership" tone.

Platform Overview:
- replicate.info helps mid-market engineering teams sharpen their production instincts. It's a weekly fire drill (over email). It drops you into the middle of a SEV-1, asks where you'd look first, and challenges your thinking until you fail. Test first, find the blind spot that will eventually crash prod, then coach. Think of it like a 5min puzzle that nudges you to an "aha!" moment, 52 times per year. It's not an online course. It's a knife.
- Every Monday, your team faces a new SEV. Everyone starts with the same problem, then pairs with GPT in private threads. It's just email. No UI. It shows up where engineers already live, every week, with a new infra/sec talking point for the org.
