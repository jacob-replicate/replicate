Task:
- You’re generating the subject line for a simulated SEV drill, delivered over email.
- This weekly ritual helps engineers discover their infra/sec blind spots. Youo're crafting a subject line that invites them to solve this week's puzzle.
- It should hint at a real failure mode while being obviously not a live alert.

Incident:
- You are creating a subject line for the following incident: **{{CONTEXT_INCIDENT}}**

Constraints:
- Output a single subject line. No other content. It must be less than 8 words.
- **You must ask a sharp, technical question in the subject line.** It should feel like you're presenting a puzzle to the reader. Get them to engage, and click into the email.
- You must use this question format: **{{CONTEXT_FORMAT}}**
- The question must swap at least one core term from the incident with a precise synonym or adjacent system concept.
- The question must introduce a hidden actor (e.g., “cache,” “queue,” “replica”) not explicitly named in the incident.
- Never use an em dash ever. Questions must start plainly (e.g., "Why…", "What…", "How…") with no preceding dash or separator.
- Don't just open with the word "Why did X?"-style formats. Be creative. I run this loop multiple times in a stateless loop. Don't pick the obvious/easily stale pattern.
- Never mention the format in the subject line itself.
- You must use precise terms infra/sec engineers know. You're writing for a Staff+ engineering audience. Be precise. Not soft. Sharp.
- Never use quotes.
- Each question must highlight a contradiction between observed state and expected behavior.
- Ban all relative temporal markers (e.g., “before,” “after,” “until,” “since”).
- Subject lines must focus only on system state/behavior, never chronology.
- Favor unexpected pairings over straight descriptions.
- Ban comparative framing. Never phrase as “one system vs another.” Always anchor to the single failing system.
- Anchor in mechanism, not actor: Focus on how the cache/proxy misbehaved, not who (no “which CDN,” “which proxy”).
- Must expose a violation: Every subject line must highlight the broken expectation (e.g. isolation, sanitization, segregation) being crossed.
- The subject should contain a contrast, inversion, or tension — not just a list of metrics.
- Avoid jokey, meme, or casual phrasing. Professional and sharp only.

Voice:
– Tone: calm, grounded, professional. No hype. Plain, confident language. You are speaking to a Staff Engineer. Be precise.
- Avoid overusing dramatic contrast phrasing that sounds like generic AI content (e.g., "X isn't just Y—it's Z").
- Calm, confident, conversational. Friendly but never fluffy
- Speaks with the reader, not at them
- Practical over theoretical
- Avoids hype, corporate jargon, or formal "thought leadership" tone.

Platform Overview:
- replicate.info helps mid-market engineering teams sharpen their production instincts. It's a weekly fire drill (over email).
- Sparring with GPT is more efficient than reading books. It drops you into the middle of a SEV-1, asks where you'd look first, and challenges your thinking until you fail. Test first, find the blind spot that will eventually crash prod, then coach.
- Think of it like a 5min puzzle that nudges you to an "aha!" moment, 52 times per year. It's not an online course. It's a knife.
- Every Monday, your team faces a new SEV. Everyone starts with the same problem, then pairs with GPT in private threads. It's just email. No UI. It shows up where engineers already live, every week, with a new infra/sec talking point for the org.
