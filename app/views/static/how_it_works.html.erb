  <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-8">How it Works</h1>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <%= link_to 'replicate.info', root_path, class: "text-blue-600 font-semibold" %> is a virtual staff engineer who quietly coaches your team (via email, every Monday).
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    It finds the blind spots most likely to slow down delivery or cause production issues, then helps your engineers work through them with guidance tailored to their level.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    There's no UI. No settings. No onboarding. Managers paste their team's email addresses once, and coaching begins in each engineers' inbox the following week.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    The LLM prompts aren't generic. They're based on my 15 years of <%= link_to 'startup experience', 'https://linkedin.com/in/jacobcomer', target: "_blank", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-medium hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4 decoration-1 transition" %>, and written to feel like the coaching you'd get from a senior teammate with battle scars. I've spent a lot of time distilling hard-earned lessons into clear, practical steps — so you don't have to.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-12">
    That's it. No extra work required from anyone.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">It's not about asking ChatGPT random questions</h2>
  <p class="mb-12">
    My juniors don't always know what to ask, and I don't expect them to. That said, I don't always have enough time to teach everything I've learned.
    <%= link_to 'replicate.info', root_path, class: "text-blue-600 font-semibold" %> doesn't wait for prompts. It proactively surfaces <%= link_to 'the concepts', '/knowledge-gaps', class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-medium hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4 decoration-1 transition" %> they need to grow,
    and delivers them in a way that mirrors how a great mentor would explain it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Growth you can see</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">
    Every Friday, managers get a simple email showing:
  </p>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li class="mb-1">Which topics landed with your team</li>
    <li class="mb-1">What blind spots were uncovered</li>
    <li class="mb-1">Where engineers made the most progress</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It's one of the easiest ways to level up your team — without managing another SaaS product, writing internal docs, or fighting for headspace.
