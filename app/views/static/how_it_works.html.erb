      acts like a virtual staff engineer — sending high-signal coaching emails to your team every Monday.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each message tackles a real problem that slows teams down. Think flaky tests, unclear ownership, or poor rollback planning.

      The advice is shaped by 15 years of

      and written to feel like it came from a teammate who's been there before.
    </p>

    <p>
      No dashboards. No setup. You paste in your team's emails once, and coaching starts the following Monday. Whether engineers reply or not, the system adapts and gets smarter over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's quiet, ongoing mentorship — delivered in a format engineers actually read.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Teaching what they don't know to ask</h2>

    <p>
      Your team doesn't need to ask an AI the right question.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system proactively teaches what a senior mentor would — even if no one replies. It focuses on the gaps most engineers don't spot until it's too late.
    </p>

    <p>
      Things like letting N+1 queries slip into prod, skipping rollback plans during deploys, or taking unnecessary risks during crunch time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every email is backed by a hand-crafted knowledge base and delivered in the voice of a helpful staff engineer. I've spent hundreds of hours turning real-world coaching into something your team can learn from automatically.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">Clarity for managers</h2>

    <p>Every Friday, you'll get a summary email showing:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
      <li>Which topics your team engaged with</li>
      <li>Where blind spots may exist</li>
      <li>Where progress is being made</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It's one of the simplest ways to support engineer growth without managing another tool or writing late-night docs.
      Most teams pay for it using their existing (and often underutilized) L&amp;D budget.
