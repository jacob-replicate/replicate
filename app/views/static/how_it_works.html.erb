  <h1 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-8">How it Works</h1>

  <p class="mb-4">
    <%= link_to 'replicate.info', root_path, class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-medium hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4 decoration-1 transition" %> is a virtual staff engineer that helps your team grow through short, high-signal coaching emails sent every Monday.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Each message focuses on a real problem that slows down velocity, like flaky tests, unclear ownership, or underestimating deployment risk. The advice is based on 15 years of <%= link_to 'engineering experience', "https://linkedin.com/in/jacobcomer", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-medium hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4 decoration-1 transition", target: "_blank" %> at high-growth startups, and is written to feel like it came from a teammate who's seen it before.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    There's no setup, no dashboard, and nothing to configure. You paste your team's emails once, and coaching begins the following week. It works whether your engineers reply or not. If they do, the system adapts based on their responses, and provides more tailored advice over time.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-12">
    It's like quiet, ongoing mentorship in a format engineers actually read.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Teaching what they don't know to ask</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Engineers don't need to chat with an AI. The system delivers proactive coaching that mirrors what a great mentor would explain. It's happy to engage when engineers reply, but that's not a requirement.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    It doesn't just answer questions. It teaches your team the things they didn't know to ask yet. Topics most junior and mid-level engineers haven't encountered until it's too late (e.g., letting N+1 queries slip into prod, skipping rollback plans during deploys, or how to handle risky work during crunch time).
  </p>

  <p class="mb-12">
    Every email is backed by a carefully written knowledge base and delivered in the voice of a helpful staff engineer. I've spent hundreds of hours turning real-world coaching experience into clear, trustworthy advice the system can send automatically. Check out <%= link_to "this post", "https://jacobcomer.medium.com/write-code-faster-in-vim-c564ff9b9f6c", class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 font-medium hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4 decoration-1 transition", target: "_blank" %> for an example of my teaching style.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Clarity for managers</h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Every Friday, you'll get a summary email showing:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li class="mb-1">Which topics your team engaged with</li>
    <li class="mb-1">Where blind spots may exist</li>
    <li class="mb-1">Where progress is being made</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-6">
    It's one of the simplest ways to support engineer growth without managing another tool or writing late-night docs. Most teams pay for it using their existing (and often underutilized) L&D budget.
