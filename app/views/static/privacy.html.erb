  <p class="text-gray-500 mb-4">Last updated: October 6, 2025</p>

  <p class="mb-6">
    Replicate Software, LLC ("Company") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the safeguards we maintain.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">I. Information We Collect</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
    <li><strong>Name & Email Address</strong> — collected when you sign up for drills so we can deliver the service.</li>
    <li><strong>Conversation History</strong> — copies of your coaching threads, stored temporarily to deliver replies. These are automatically deleted after 3 months of inactivity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">That's it. There's no dashboard to login to. No cookies. No payment info or customer data is collected.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">II. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
    <li>To deliver weekly SEV-1 coaching drills by email.</li>
    <li>To send product or support updates when necessary.</li>
    <li>To maintain service reliability and improve the product.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="mb-6">We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or share your information for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">III. Data Retention</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Conversation history is ephemeral. All threads are automatically deleted from Replicate's database after 3 months of inactivity. They are never shared with OpenAI for long-term GPT model training.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">IV. Vendors & Service Providers</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    We use trusted third-party providers (e.g. Postmark for email delivery, Heroku for hosting) to operate the service. These vendors act only under our instruction and do not use your data for any other purpose.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">V. Security</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256). We do not store customer data beyond what’s necessary to deliver the service. See our <a href="/security" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Security & IT Readiness</a> page for details.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">VI. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    Our service is not directed to individuals under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from them.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">VII. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p class="mb-6">
    We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Notable changes will be announced via email.
