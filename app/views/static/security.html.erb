      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Architecture</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Hosted on Heroku (AWS)</h3>
      <p>All infrastructure runs on isolated US cloud resources, with encrypted storage and enforced HTTPS.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Data encrypted in transit and at rest</h3>
      <p>All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256, managed by Heroku's infrastructure.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No access to your customers' data</h3>
      <p>The platform does not integrate with your internal systems. It sends coaching emails to your engineers and helps them think through production risks. We persist your team's conversation history (for personalized coaching insights), and automatically delete that data within 12 months.</p>

      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Access & Delivery</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No user accounts or logins</h3>
      <p>Coaching is delivered by email. No sessions, passwords, or user-managed devices.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No integrations required</h3>
      <p>We do not connect to GitHub, Jira, Slack, SMTP servers, or any other internal tool.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">You own your data</h3>
      <p>Coaching conversation history is only retained for up to 12 months to personalize future learning sessions.

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Planned shutdowns</h3>
      <p>In the case of a planned end-of-service, customers would receive advance notice and a downloadable archive of recent coaching history, prompts, and full source code. Support would remain available through the shutdown window.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Provisioning and SCIM</h3>
      <p>SCIM is planned for early 2026. Admins currently manage employee access by emailing <a href="mailto:support@replicate.info" class="text-blue-600 font-medium hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">support@replicate.info</a>
