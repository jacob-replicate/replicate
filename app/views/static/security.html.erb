    The platform is <span class="font-semibold">email-based</span> by design. No logins, dashboards, integrations, or SSO.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Heroku receives an email webhook, routes it through GPT, and sends the result to your team. That's it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I lead IAM for an infra/security market leader, and spent most of <%= link_to 'my career', 'https://linkedin.com/in/jacobcomer', class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition font-semibold" %> building enterprise software for regulated industries. I built Replicate to help keep me sharp. It doesn't pretend to be more than it is.

    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Architecture</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Hosted on Heroku + AWS</h3>
      <p>All infrastructure runs on isolated US cloud resources, with encrypted storage and enforced HTTPS.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Data encrypted in transit and at rest</h3>
      <p>All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256..</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No access to your customers' data</h3>
      <p>The platform does not integrate with your internal systems. It sends coaching emails to your engineers and helps them think through production risks. The platform processes low-sensitivity data: engineer names, work email addresses, and GPT-generated coaching conversation history.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Audit logging</h3>
      <p>Administrative actions (e.g., organization deletions) are logged immutably and retained for 12 months in secure, append-only S3 buckets.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Automated dependency scanning</h3>
      <p>The codebase is continuously scanned using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">GitHub Dependabot</a> to patch vulnerable libraries. Critical vulnernabilities are patched within 7 days of public disclosure.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Incident response</h3>
      <p>I run PagerDuty on my phone 24/7. In the event of a confirmed incident, I'll send a root cause analysis and remediation summary (from <%= mail_to 'security@replicate.info', 'security@replicate.info', class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition" %>) to impacted customers within 72 hours.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Access & Delivery</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No user accounts or logins for engineers</h3>
      <p>Coaching is delivered by email. No sessions, passwords, or user-managed devices.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">User provisioning (SCIM, SSO)</h3>
      <p>SCIM is planned as an <span class="font-medium">optional</span> enhancement for mid-2026. Administrators currently manage access by emailing personnel changes to <a href="mailto:support@replicate.info" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">support@replicate.info</a>. They will soon be able to login to a secure admin portal (via <a href="https://auth0.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">Auth0 SSO</a>) to manage team members and billing. No user tracking, just logistics.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">You own your data</h3>
      <p>Inactive conversations are automatically deleted after 3 months. I use that data to recreate email history when engineers reply a few weeks later. No AI training. Email <a href="mailto:support@replicate.info" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">support@replicate.info</a> to request immediate deletion. It won't get stuck in a Postgres backup forever.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Planned shutdowns</h3>
      <p>In the case of a planned end-of-service, customers will receive advance notice and a downloadable archive of recent coaching history, prompts, and full source code. Support will remain available throughout the shutdown window.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Compliance</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Insurance coverage</h3>
      <p>Replicate Software, LLC maintains $1M Errors & Omissions and $1M Cyber Liability coverage via <a href="https://vouch.us" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Vouch</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Vendor due diligence</h3>
      <p>All subprocessors undergo a documented security review prior to onboarding, including review of GDPR compliance and Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) where applicable.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No redlines, vendor portals, or negotiations</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="font-semibold">MSA</span> and (optional)
        <span class="font-semibold">DPA</span> are standardized. Pre-signed versions are emailed during the <a href="/billing" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">trial period</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Subprocessors</h2>

      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
        All vendors are GDPR compliant, offer Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), and underwent security review prior to onboarding. This is the full list. No other products (e.g., Google Analytics) interact with your data.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Heroku (AWS)</h3>
      <p>Used for infrastructure and encrypted storage. All workloads run in isolated containers with HTTPS enforced and AES-256 encryption at rest.

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">OpenAI</h3>
      <p>OpenAI's API powers the real-time content generation for coaching emails. None of your data is persisted by OpenAI. None of it is used to train their models. The prompting is ephemeral.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Postmark</h3>
      <p>Used for transactional email delivery. No open/click tracking. No marketing newsletters.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Stripe</h3>
      <p>Used for payment processing and invoicing.</p>
