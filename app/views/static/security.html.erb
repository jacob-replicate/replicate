    This platform sends <span class="font-semibold">coaching emails</span> to your engineers. <span class="font-semibold">No logins, dashboards, integrations, or SSO.</span>
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Heroku receives a webhook, routes it through GPT, and emails the result to your team. That's it.

  <p class="mb-4">
    <span class="font-semibold">No access to customer data.</span> If users type it anyway, I have <a href="/replicate-coi.pdf" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-semibold" target="_blank">$1M E&O</a> + <a href="/replicate-coi.pdf" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-semibold" target="_blank">$1M Cyber Liability</a> coverage.

  <p class="mb-4">
    I lead IAM for an infra/sec market leader, and spent most of <%= link_to 'my career', 'https://linkedin.com/in/jacobcomer', class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition font-semibold" %> building for regulated industries. Replicate is the opposite of that world. I have <span class="font-semibold">0 employees</span> and everything's automated. <span class="font-semibold">No SOC 2 yet.</span>
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">

  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">
    You will receive a <a href="/replicate-msa-dpa.pdf" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-semibold">pre-signed MSA</a> during the <a href="/billing" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline font-semibold">trial period</a>. It includes a required <span class="font-semibold">DPA</span> as well.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4">Liability is capped at <span class="font-semibold">3x the fees</span> paid across your entire contract, even if multi-year. This excludes <span class="font-semibold">serious misconduct</span> liability (e.g., IP infringement), which is uncapped as it should be.</p>

  <p>
    I don't engage with <span class="font-semibold">RFP's</span>, <span class="font-semibold">redlines</span>, <span class="font-semibold">vendor portals</span>, or any other type of negotiation. I took all of the changes I used to request as a buyer, and baked them into my standard operating procedures.

      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Architecture</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Hosted on Heroku (AWS)</h3>
      <p>All infra is provisioned/managed by Heroku (in the <span class="font-semibold">us-east-1</span> AWS region, with Heroku's HA failover).</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Data encrypted in transit and at rest</h3>
      <p>All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256, with a minimum of TLS 1.2 in transit.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No cookie policy</h3>
      <p>I don't store visitor state (via cookies, or any other method). No logins, no GA, no need for a policy for tech that I'm not using on the site.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Backup process</h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.heroku.com/postgres" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">Heroku Postgres</a> maintains rolling database backups, and prunes old snapshots automatically over time. Backups can be restored in minutes, and are captured at least once every 24 hours.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Audit logging</h3>
      <p>Administrative actions (e.g., organization deletions) are logged immutably and retained for 12 months in secure, append-only S3 buckets.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Automated dependency scanning</h3>
      <p>The codebase is continuously scanned using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/dependabot-quickstart-guide" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">GitHub Dependabot</a> to patch vulnerable libraries. Critical vulnernabilities are patched within 7 days of public disclosure.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Incident response</h3>
      <p>I run PagerDuty on my phone 24/7. In the event of a confirmed incident, I'll send a root cause analysis and remediation summary (from <%= mail_to 'security@replicate.info', 'security@replicate.info', class: "text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition" %>) to impacted customers within 72 hours.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Access & Delivery</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No user accounts for engineers</h3>
      <p>Coaching is delivered by email. No sessions, passwords, or user-managed devices.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-1">User provisioning (SCIM, SSO)</h3>
      <p>SCIM is planned as an <span class="font-medium">optional</span> enhancement for 2026. Administrators currently manage access by emailing personnel changes to <a href="mailto:support@replicate.info" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">support@replicate.info</a>. They will soon be able to login to a secure admin portal (via <a href="https://auth0.com" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">Auth0 SSO</a>) to manage team members and billing. No user tracking, just logistics.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">If you sign up a few weeks beforehand, it will be an opt-in process. GRC and security teams will have as much time as they need to validate + approve/deny the process change. I don't have all the details yet, but will say that I've spent most of my career focused on enterprise IAM. I think approvals will be quick.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-1">You own your data</h3>
      <p>Inactive conversations are automatically deleted after 3 months. I use that data to recreate email history when engineers reply a few weeks later. No AI training. Email <a href="mailto:support@replicate.info" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">support@replicate.info</a> to request immediate deletion. It won't get stuck in a Postgres backup forever.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-6 mb-1">Planned end-of-service</h3>
      <p>If I ever spin down the business, you'll receive advance notice, full source code, your data, and next steps. Support will remain available during the shutdown window. That said, I built Replicate to keep myself sharp. It's not going away anytime soon. Sparring with GPT is faster than reading books.

    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Subprocessors</h2>

      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
        All vendors are GDPR compliant, offer Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), and underwent security review prior to onboarding. This is the full list. No other products (e.g., Google Analytics) interact with your data.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Heroku (AWS)</h3>
      <p>Used for infrastructure and encrypted storage. All workloads run in isolated containers with HTTPS enforced and AES-256 encryption at rest.

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">OpenAI</h3>
      <p>OpenAI's API powers the real-time content generation for coaching emails. None of your data is persisted by OpenAI. None of it is used to train their models. The prompting is ephemeral.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Postmark</h3>
      <p>Used for transactional email delivery. No open/click tracking. No marketing newsletters.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Stripe</h3>
      <p>Used for delivering and processing invoices. No auto-renewal. You manually approve every payment.</p>
