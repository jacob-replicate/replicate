    <%= link_to 'replicate.info', root_path, class: "text-blue-600 font-semibold" %> is email-based by design. No dashboards, no logins, no integrations, no SSO. The architecture minimizes risk, and follows modern security practices without any complexity.

  <p>
    The platform was designed by <%= link_to 'Jacob Comer', 'https://linkedin.com/in/jacobcomer', class: "text-blue-600 font-medium hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition" %>, a Staff Engineer with 15 years of experience. He most recently led IAM for an infra/security market leader, and spent over a decade building enterprise software for regulated environments. Email <%= mail_to 'security@replicate.info', 'security@replicate.info', class: "text-blue-600 font-medium hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition" %> if you have any questions.

      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Architecture</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Hosted on Heroku (AWS)</h3>
      <p>All infrastructure runs on isolated US cloud resources, with encrypted storage and enforced HTTPS.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Data encrypted in transit and at rest</h3>
      <p>All data is encrypted at rest using AES-256, managed by Heroku's infrastructure.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No access to your customers' data</h3>
      <p>The platform does not integrate with your internal systems. It sends coaching emails to your engineers and helps them think through production risks. We persist your team's conversation history (to generate personalized coaching insights), and automatically delete that data every 12 months.</p>

    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Access & Delivery</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No user accounts or logins for engineers</h3>
      <p>Coaching is delivered by email. No sessions, passwords, or user-managed devices.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">User Provisioning (SCIM, SSO)</h3>
      <p>SCIM is planned as an <span class="font-medium">optional</span> enhancement for mid-2026. Administrators currently manage access by emailing personnel changes to <a href="mailto:support@replicate.info" class="text-blue-600 font-medium hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">support@replicate.info</a>. They will soon be able to login to a secure admin portal (via <a href="https://auth0.com" class="text-blue-600 font-medium hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">Auth0 SSO</a>) to manage team members and billing. No user tracking, just logistics.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">You own your data</h3>
      <p>Conversation history is only retained for up to 12 months to personalize future learning sessions. You can permanently delete all of your organization's data at any time by emailing <a href="mailto:support@replicate.info" class="text-blue-600 font-medium hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition">support@replicate.info</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Planned shutdowns</h3>
      <p>In the case of a planned end-of-service, customers would receive advance notice and a downloadable archive of recent coaching history, prompts, and full source code. Support would remain available through the shutdown window.</p>

      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Compliance</h2>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">SOC 2 Type 1 planned for 2026</h3>
      <p>Documentation is available for teams evaluating vendor readiness.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">No redlines</h3>
      <p>Our documents (<a href="/w9.pdf" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">W-9</a>, <a href="/dpa.pdf" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">DPA</a>, <a href="/msa.pdf" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">MSA</a>) are standardized and public. No vendor portals, no negotiation loops. Contact <%= mail_to 'security@replicate.info', 'security@replicate.info', class: "text-blue-600 font-medium hover:text-blue-700 hover:underline transition" %> if you have questions, or want to request signable, digital copies.

      <h2 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-2xl tracking-tight">Subprocessors</h2>

      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
        All vendors below support GDPR compliance and offer Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) where required. This is the full list. There are no other subprocessors (e.g., Google Analytics) that interact with your data.
      </p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Heroku (AWS)</h3>
      <p>Used for infrastructure and encrypted storage. All workloads run in isolated dynos with HTTPS enforced and AES-256 encryption at rest.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">OpenAI</h3>
      <p>We use OpenAI's API for real-time content generation for coaching emails. None of your data is persisted by OpenAI, and none of it is used to train their models. The prompting is completely ephemeral. Enterprise customers may request alternate LLM providers if required by internal policy.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Postmark</h3>
      <p>Used for transactional email delivery. No open or click tracking is enabled.</p>

      <h3 class="font-semibold mt-4 mb-1">Stripe</h3>
      <p>Used for payment processing and invoicing.</p>
