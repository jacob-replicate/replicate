You and Company therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (&ldquo;Informal Dispute Resolution Conference&rdquo;).

Notice to Company that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to: support@replicate.info. The Notice must include: (1)&nbsp;your name, telephone number, mailing address, e&#8208;mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2)&nbsp;the name, telephone number, mailing address and e&#8208;mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3)&nbsp;a description of your Dispute. </span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party&rsquo;s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</span></p><ol class="c13 lst-kix_list_8-2" start="3"><li class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c7">Arbitration Rules and Forum.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; These Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. &sect; 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement and any arbitration proceedings.

A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the &ldquo;Request&rdquo;). The Request must include: (1)&nbsp;the name, telephone number, mailing address, e&#8208;mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2)&nbsp;a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3)&nbsp;a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good&#8208;faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4)&nbsp;a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5)&nbsp;evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.</span></li></ol><p class="c8"><span class="c4">If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel&rsquo;s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. By signing the Request, counsel certifies to the best of counsel&rsquo;s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (1)&nbsp;the Request is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2)&nbsp;the claims, defenses and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3)&nbsp;the factual and damages contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">Unless you and Company otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in Subsection 10.2(h) is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Subject to the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration. If the JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable JAMS Rules.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">You and Company agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties&rsquo; attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</span></p><ol class="c13 lst-kix_list_8-2" start="4"><li class="c5"><span class="c15 c7">Authority of Arbitrator.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes subject to arbitration hereunder including, without limitation, any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1)&nbsp;all Disputes arising out of or relating to the subsection entitled &ldquo;Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief,&rdquo; including any claim that all or part of the subsection entitled &ldquo;Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief&rdquo; is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such subsection entitled &ldquo;Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief&rdquo; has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2)&nbsp;except as expressly contemplated in the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration,&rdquo; all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3)&nbsp;all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4)&nbsp;all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in the subsection entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration.&rdquo; The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum&rsquo;s rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c4">&nbsp;</span><span class="c15 c7">Waiver of Jury Trial.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;IN SECTION 10.2(A)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;YOU </span><span class="c4">AND THE COMPANY PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND H</span><span class="c4">AVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and the Company Parties are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 10.2(a) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.&nbsp;</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c15 c7">Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION </span><span class="c4">10.2(H)</span><span class="c4">&nbsp;EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party&rsquo;s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under the Subsection 10.2(h) entitled &ldquo;Batch Arbitration.&rdquo; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, &ldquo;Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief,&rdquo; are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Company agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of Virginia. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Company from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c15 c7">Attorneys&rsquo; Fees and Costs.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; The parties shall bear their own attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). If you or Company need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the Informal Dispute Resolution Process, is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs.</span></li><li class="c5"><span class="c7 c15">Batch Arbitration.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Company agree that in the event that there are 100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Company by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the JAMS shall (1)&nbsp;administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2)&nbsp;appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3)&nbsp;provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (&ldquo;Batch Arbitration&rdquo;).</span></li></ol><p class="c8"><span class="c4">All parties agree that Requests are of a &ldquo;substantially similar nature&rdquo; if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the JAMS, and the JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (&ldquo;Administrative Arbitrator&rdquo;). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator&rsquo;s fees shall be paid by Company.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">You and Company agree to cooperate in good faith with the JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1)&nbsp;the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2)&nbsp;the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.</span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c4">This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</span></p><ol class="c13 lst-kix_list_8-2" start="9"><li class="c5"><span class="c15 c7">30-Day Right to Opt Out.</span><span class="c4">&nbsp; You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 240 Club Dr, Apt 207, Ruckersville, Virginia 22968, or email to support@replicate.info, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Company as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred.
