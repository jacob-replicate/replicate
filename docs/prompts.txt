Launch
- Include relevant links in prompts if needed

- Wire up email invitation flow

Not really
- Fix scrolling + viewport height issue in chat view
- Auto-focus the input box (on desktop at least)
- Weird border on conversation input box - left side gets cut off

Eventually:
- Make a new Apple ID for IBM phone so you can keep texting yourself
-------------
- Handle page refreshes while streaming text during demo.
- Tighten up Terms + Privacy + Security + Features docs
- Instead of linking to Google searches, just generate your own content, and link to it (to keep emails tight).
    - You could also just go super in-depth in the emails themselves too (if they ask for it).
- Cleaner mobile header links
