Launch

- Make example report talk about early warning signs (around their incident, not cleaning up the mess).
- Wire up emails + webhooks + invitation flow
- Wire up the weekly check-in flow
- Wire up the weekly manager report flow

Eventually:
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Stripe Atlas
- Handle page refreshes while streaming text during demo.
- Tighten up Terms + Privacy + Security + Features docs
- Instead of linking to Google searches, just generate your own content, and link to it (to keep emails tight).
- Make a new Apple ID for IBM phone so you can keep texting yourself

Not blocking:
------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix scrolling + viewport height issue in chat view
- Auto-focus the input box (on desktop at least)
- Weird border on conversation input box - left side gets cut off
