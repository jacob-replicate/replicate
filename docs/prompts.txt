- Make a new Apple ID for IBM phone so you can keep texting yourself
- Include relevant links in prompts if needed
- Auto-focus the input box (on desktop at least)
- Wire up email invitation flow
- Nudge the prompt with conversation-specific outcomes (e.g., nudge them toward a sales decision, include short CTA's)
- Improve the design (e.g., bigger text)
- Don't use the explicit phrase "Call to Action"
- Remove the hardcoded database indexing callout in the landing page incident prompt. It shows up in every report.
- Mobile header links



Eventually:
- Handle page refreshes while streaming text during demo.
