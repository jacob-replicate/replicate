Delegate: Generate Invitation URL (for EM's)
- Before sharing link, nudge EM's to emphasize the opt-in nature
- Include language that this product automatically opt-outs disengaged engineers
- Provide a copy/paste-able Slack message they can use (non-pushy, opt-in language)

Delegate: Invitation Page
- Emphasize the automated opt-out nature of the product. The cancellation email comes to you.
- Offer beginner/intermediate/advanced radio buttons, and an optional textarea to describe your role in-depth
  - This helps over-confident people (who do NOT need your tool) self-select, get humbled their first week, and quietly rebuild their identity in private.
  - "I've been doing this a while — feel free to skip the basics." - don't trigger ego, come up with friendly sentences for each ("I could use some extra help with the fundamentals")

Delegate: Cold Email Engine
- Build the core data models + prompting/generation services yourself. Delegate everything else.
- Give yourself a way to assign emails to a contractor's UUID, and send them that email over whatever gig working site you found them on. No logins to approve, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks, just bookmarks.
- Build UI for contractors to review emails, approve, reject, regenerate
- Admin approval UI -- i.e., give yourself a way to judge new contractors before queueing their approved emails
- Once approved, queue these emails for delivery in scheduled job. Block emails (at runtime, not just schedule time) if the user provided their email on the site. They get "Invite your team" drip campaign now.

Delegate: Automated Opt-out
- Send a separate break-up email if they go 3 weeks without opening your content. Bump the next "automated_opt_out" to 5 weeks, 7, etc. -- Cap at 12.
- Send an email to their manager if they opt out, not judging, just that their bill is reduced.

Trial -> Paid Transition
- Just send a fixed ActionMailer template to the EM. No need to get fancy. You have 10 engineers. It'll cost $300/mo. Do you want to proceed?
- If they say yes to that thread, mark them as active, send an invoice next month.
- Grade this email response heavily. If it's not an obvious yes or no (or lack of reply), ask them to clarify.
- Maybe: Add a step for manual review if you can't figure it out.

Delegate: Invite Reminder
- Send a series of fixed invitation reminders (e.g., day 2 of inactivity "Still thinking about trying out replicate.info? Here's a (new) message you can copy/paste into Slack")

Orchestration
- Build tone grading into Prompt.execute calls where the :human_voice param is set to "true"
    - Automatically retry (with feedback) if didn't pass 90% threshold. Add in guardrails to avoid infinite loops.

Initial Email
- Build separate prompts for this one. It needs to be insanely great. It also needs to introduce them to the system.

Weekly Emails
- Build a "wince list" of painful mistakes, based on seniority. Juniors get an email similar to "shipped an N+1", staff get "didn't test rollback strategy, and it bit us"
    - If no previous emails, default to this list.
- Use a consistent format, spread across multiple prompts to prevent tone drift. Subject -> Heading -> Hook -> Insight -> Reflection -> Signature
- Give GPT context around past topics (subject lines + internal 1-line summaries) so it doesn't repeat itself
- Make reply optional but warmly invited. Some people think of this as extra work.
- Schedule emails to go out at 11am
- Eventually: Make GPT grade itself on "Does this modular block match this copy/paste example from Jacob's blog?"
    - If not, regenerate the prompt. Bake this into Prompt.new().execute, so you don't have to write it a million times.
- Eventually: Send a follow-up email in the middle of the week if they didn't open it
- Include an unsubscribe link in the footer

Manager Reports
- Compress the past few weekly emails into a single report. Use prompts for each bullet point of each engineers' report.

Topic Selector
- Take in past message history. Most recent thread gets full fidelity, older threads get decreasingly large summaries.
- Make sure to analyze not just the subject line, but also the content of the email to determine the topic. They'll engage + change topics. Don't cover that new topic next week.
- Include their current level summary

Eventually
- Dataclips to track engagement (reply rates, open rates, etc)
