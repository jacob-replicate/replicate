- Incident selector on homepage / within the conversation.

- New script to judge the conversation so far, and figure out which elements from the list below to include.
- Then you can just inject them into "special instructions" + not clog up the prompt with a bunch of formatting instructions it doesn't need.
- Ask GPT for an array of element types to render, then only pass those into the next prompt to render in full.
- You have used them the following times already: { "line_graph": 5, "bar_chart": 3, "diff_view": 2 }. Mix it up.

- New elements:
    - Single article highlight (show the first paragraph, faded -- not a title + description)

    - Diff view to highlight PR changes
        - https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html?tab=readme-ov-file#online-example

    - Table (e.g. config diffs, replica status, customer impact matrix)

    - Timeline (e.g. event order, deployment propagation)
        - This is just a text summary. You don't need a fancy JS library.

    - Bar Chart (e.g. per-zone errors, API versions in use)
        - https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=bar-simple

    - Scatterplot (e.g. latency vs correctness, node drift)
        - https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-simple

    - Heatmap (e.g. fault intensity across services or zones)
        - https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=heatmap-cartesian

    - Sequence Diagram (e.g. write flow across services)
    - Cards -- show some text, and it flips to other text whenever you click on it
    - Flow charts
    - "Edit this SQL" to run commands. GPT just makes shit up based on what they type.
    - Group chat transcripts - "where's the flaw in their thinking here?"
    - Share this SEV with your friends link (replicate.info/retry-storm)


Quality of life:
- Scroll to the top of Replicate's message, not to the input box. Focus -> scroll, in that order. Most noticeable in articles with huge replies, but can happen in coaching too.
- Fix missing "Loading..." after articles load for "What am I missing here?" prompt.
- Shared validation rules to reject em dashes, semi-colons outside of code blocks, etc. Tiny shit that it often misses.
- Gsub out ’ characters
- Validation to cut out widows and orphans on desktop -- i.e., character count validations at the prompt level.
- Edit messages + Regenerate button (soft delete everything >= created_at of the message you want to regen from)
- Make certain technical phrases clickable, and link to an article convo
- Stop showing a blank conversation when you use the back button.
- Figure out why it sometimes just dies. OpenAI upstream issues? Add a "Hey, this is awkward. Put in your email to continue later." or something.
- Show multiple choice options in persisted conversation -- can't just generate in JS -- MessageElement, maybe?
- Figure out why auditing doesn't work

Paid Version
----------------------

- Login to support@ + jacob@ on your phone just in case.

Paid Version:
- Monthly email report format to Directors. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Additional tracks? Security, GRC, etc.

Email:
- Audit what needs to be ported over once you eventually transition back into the paid version (e.g., multiple choice, article links, etc).
- Make it possible to clone a conversation into a separate web-based fork. Don't try to maintain two channels in a single conversation.
- Make sure to add the resubscribe link in the final "We're auto-unsubscribing you" email. -- and maybe actually send one?
- After first contract, pay ~$1k for a verified checkmark in Gmail -- VMC - Verified Mark Certificate, like Verisign for logos. Need a custom trademarked logo too.
- Add an email after auto-delete of data, but somebody replies to a super old thread -- "Sorry, I might have auto-deleted that conversation after 3 months of inactivity. <Want to start a new one? Type 1. for secrets management 2. for something else 3. for whatever"

Not Super Important:
----------------------
- Cancel try-replicate + Apollo billing. Zero traction from cold email + feels spammy. Seeing traction from ads. Lean in.
- Carousel screenshots for conversations + code snippets
- YouTube video
- Check conversation scrolling on mobile -- doing it too early?
- First name in coaching loop emails if known? Only do that for Contact, not Member?
- Double check all your plans for overcharging (e.g., Apollo, Postmark, etc)
- Add more incidents. You have 6 weeks total (really 5 -- initial + 5 weeks)
- Don't send weekly emails to people who bounced. Bounce check on cold, not on transactional? - Postmark does this automatically?
- Handle email throttling for abuse
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Create a procurement PDF you can link to in your "Welcome to replicate.info!" email?
- Automated data deletion + audit logging
