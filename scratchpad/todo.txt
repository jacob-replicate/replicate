Cold
- More variants (+ #total_variants message to count?)
- Scrape directors

Transactional
- Postmark webhooks for coaching loop replies - https://account.postmarkapp.com/servers/16407823/streams/inbound/get-started
- QA weekly email worker + rake
- Cron job to start monday email loops
- Email formatting for intro. "Meet Alex, They did somethign" - Make sure the name doesn't align with first letter in their email.
- Unsubscribe page with confirmation form, to prevent accidental unsubscribe (doesn't matter for cold, you're never following up).
- Manually wire up 2-3 initial incidents + subject lines
- Email regex validation. AI grading on form submission - you're gonna get a lot of bullshit responses to grade once public.

------- LAUNCH ----------

Soon
- Add auto-unsubscribe logic (check it at runtime to account for last-minute messages)
- Terms + Privacy + MSA/DPA review
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Add an example URL to copy/paste in the "Not the right time?" box. Give them the value ASAP.
- Monthly email report format to Directors. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Figure out when bills land in Mercury account, so you can fund the account on time.
- Automated data deletion + audit logging
- Move Missive to Mercury account

Eventually:
- Cron job to filter inbox + draft replies
- Upsert metadata, so you can keep track of job changes. DB is going to get stale otherwise.
- Better error handling if emails fail (e.g., bounce, throttling, etc)
- :coaching_should_continue prompt -- uncomment guard clause in coaching message generator
- Set up process for cold email addresses that failed bounce check. Funnel bad data into a CSV that Fiverr can clean up + send back.
- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
- GPT 5

- Marketing newsletter. Just drop them into the typical queue. 3-week pause.
    - Just drop them into the normal rotation for awhile. Then gradually pull it away with a stronger upsell nudge in the footers.
    - They still have to copy/paste the links in Slack (e.g., replicate.info/retry-storm) to their team.

- Move payments to Mercury account, not personal card.
    - https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1G8nwfu3FUkew3KPd7IuhyPkZy3HNZe8W
    - Reopen Apollo eventually
    - Double check all of your addresses.
    - Double check Mailreach invoices
