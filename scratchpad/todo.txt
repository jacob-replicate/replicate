Trial -> Paid Transition
- Just send a fixed ActionMailer template to the EM. No need to get fancy. You have 10 engineers. It'll cost $300/mo. Do you want to proceed?
- If they say yes to that thread (by clicking a link), mark them as active, send an invoice next month.
- Send a reminder email if they get closer to deadline, and have active users, but no action.

Compression Service
- Compress message threads into usable, concise summaries (3-5 sentences), with grading

Legal
- MSA
- DPA (tighten up line on Security's "Compliance & Whatever" section -- still says avaialble, doesn't link to template)
- W9 /w9.pdf

Manager Reports
- Compress the past few weekly emails into a single report. Use prompts for each bullet point of each engineers' report.
    - Need your team's signup link again? Click here to share it.
    - Reply to this email anytime with questions or if you'd like to adjust your plan.

Topic Selector
- Take in past message history. Most recent thread gets full fidelity, older threads get decreasingly large summaries.
- Make sure to analyze not just the subject line, but also the content of the email to determine the topic. They'll engage + change topics. Don't cover that new topic next week.
- Include their current level summary

Eventually
- Dataclips to track engagement (reply rates, open rates, etc)
