Weekly Routine
- Monitor Mailreach warming signals
- Monitor Postmark bounces
- Check in on invoicing tasks
- Check in on infra metrics

Tech
- Postmark webhooks for coaching loop replies - https://account.postmarkapp.com/servers/16407823/streams/inbound/get-started
- cron job to stagger out weekly emails
- Wire up cold email sends
    - Skip if name doesn't have 2 words. There's only like 8 of those contacts in prod atm.
- :coaching_should_continue prompt -- uncomment guard clause in coaching message generator
- Safeguard to prevent duplicate Sidekiq jobs to send duplicate cold/loop emails

Email Deliverability
- Track bounces via Postmark webhooks. Auto-retry on soft bounces, pause + alert owner on hard bounces.
- Verify all leads before sending (NeverBounce or Bouncer)
- Update Mailreach to only warm on weekdays, and eventually pause during Tues/Wed/Thurs
- Cap at ~150/day per inbox (cold)
- Ensure DKIM, SPF, DMARC aligned per domain
- Stagger sends over a few hours
- Finish code to fetch unique cold email variants + add data model to support tracking
- Finish DKIM validation setup

Eventually:
- Legal review of docs, fine to just ChatGPT them for now
- Wire up Zapier + Gmail, so you can auto-label replies in Missive.
- Marketing newsletter - initial email puzzle (e.g., /incidents/corrupted-invoices) -- already tracking emails, don't need to send yet
- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
- Calendar reminder 8 weeks post-launch to rotate CTA + subject sets. Don't re-use sets.
- Derisk with EU entities (Business in Estonia, Wise for banking, Proton Mail for SMTP, etc)
- Automate billing
- Add Precedence: auto_reply if Gmail starts collapsing transactional threads
- Add failover awareness if Postmark is down (hold send, log, retry)
- Add fallback logic for email failures (e.g. retry via loop@use-replicate.info)
