Eventually:
- Legal review of docs, fine to just ChatGPT them for now
- Cron job to filter inbox + draft replies
- Tailscale VPN while traveling (so you can reuse home IP for cold email replies)
- Marketing newsletter - initial email puzzle (e.g., /incidents/corrupted-invoices) -- already tracking emails, don't need to send yet
- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
- Better error handling if emails fail (e.g., bounce, throttling, etc)
- :coaching_should_continue prompt -- uncomment guard clause in coaching message generator
