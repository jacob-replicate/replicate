Product
- Remove <p> + random padding top at the top of emails. (e.g., "Hey there" lines, initial line of replies)
- Add the monday cron job back to Heroku
- Check for inbound payloads in webhook processor
- "SEV-1 Training:" prefix (no [ ] characters). Turns into "SEV-1:" after the user sends ~10 messages.

Untested:
- ColdEmailScheduler (Don't email people from the same domain multiple times in the same month)
- Contact
- EnrichContactsWorker
- Prompts::Base
- Prompts::CoachingIntro (since it has custom logic -- which you might not even need?)

Content
- More cold email variants
- 2-3 great email incidents

------- LAUNCH ----------

Legal
- Terms + Privacy + MSA/DPA review

Resubscribe
- Make sure to add the resubscribe link in the final "We're auto-unsubscribing you" email.

Cold Unsubscribe
- Maybe make it a confirmation box? Why stop yourself from hitting people again in a few months?

Product
- Don't send weekly emails to people who bounced. Bounce check on cold, not on transactional? - Postmark does this automatically?
- Scrape company website to figure out careers page + tech stack (if you can)
- Add BIMI DNS record for logo.svg - https://mxtoolbox.com/dmarc/bimi/how-to-create-bimi-record (logo might be blurry)
- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
- GPT 5 (in email, at least, not on web where it's slow af)
- :coaching_should_continue prompt -- uncomment guard clause in coaching message generator
- Add an email after auto-delete of data, but somebody replies to a super old thread -- "Sorry, I might have auto-deleted that conversation after 3 months of inactivity. <Want to start a new one? Type 1. for secrets management 2. for something else 3. for whatever"
- Handle email throttling - not a day 1 problem

Ops
- Figure out how to figure out in Postmark's UI if emails bounced, so you can manually flag + notify the account owner.
- Move Missive to Mercury account
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Cron job to filter inbox + draft replies
- Automatic postgres backups
- Figure out when bills land in Mercury account, so you can fund the account on time.
- Double check Apollo invoicing + Mercury card transition
- Find Apollo payment receipt from late August (~$59) + brainstorm any vendors you missed. Double check for all invoices.
- Auth0 + SCIM + Self-serve admin UI
- How will you know if your Bouncer credits are almost up?

Sales
- Add a "check your spam folder" message to the homepage after you submit the form
- Create a procurement PDF you can link to in your "Welcome to replicate.info!" email?
- Monthly email report format to Directors. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Bouncer API call on owner email with loading spinner
- Add an example URL to copy/paste in the "Not the right time?" box. Give them the value ASAP.
- Set up process for cold email addresses that failed bounce check. Funnel bad data into a CSV that Fiverr can clean up + send back.
- Upsert contact metadata, so you can keep track of job changes. DB is going to get stale otherwise.
- [Maybe] Accordion left/right links floated around the homepage conversation. Nobody clicks that shit though.

Reliability
- Sentry
- PagerDuty (or alternative, maybe, so you don't mix with Hashi? Sentry app, maybe?)
- APM? Librato equivalent?
- Add auto-unsubscribe logic (check it at runtime to account for last-minute messages)
- Bounce webhook reporting

Security
- Automated data deletion + audit logging
- After first contract, pay ~$1k for a verified checkmark in Gmail -- VMC - Verified Mark Certificate, like Verisign for logos
