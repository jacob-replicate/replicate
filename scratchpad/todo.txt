- Postmark webhooks for coaching loop replies - https://account.postmarkapp.com/servers/16407823/streams/inbound/get-started
- Cron job to stagger out weekly loop emails + weekly cold emails (assuming Contact#state is in the US)

Eventually:
- Upload COI - https://account.vouch.us/members/coi?email=jacob%40replicate.info
- MSA
- DPA
- Legal review of docs, fine to just ChatGPT them for now
- RDS + Mini PC (Xubuntu) + VPN
- Bounce checks (See: contact#passed_bounce_check?)
- Safeguard to prevent duplicate Sidekiq jobs to send duplicate cold/loop emails
- Cron job to filter inbox + draft replies
- Marketing newsletter - initial email puzzle (e.g., /incidents/corrupted-invoices) -- already tracking emails, don't need to send yet
- Better error handling if emails fail (e.g., bounce, throttling, etc)
- :coaching_should_continue prompt -- uncomment guard clause in coaching message generator
- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
