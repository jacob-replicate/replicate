Website:
- Incident selector on homepage / within the conversation. Add a timer + redirect back to the selector?
- Multiple choice options on what to learn next in article view. Never drop those. Fuck the "Answer yes" option, just click on one of 3 great follow-ups. Persist them.
- "Close incident" button? There's no sense of closure right now. Should there be?
- More off-ramps (e.g., status report, email form, "share this link with your team in Slack" on weekdays, "add your work email" on weekends)
- More visual "coaching explain prompt? Did you already solve this with paragraphs?
- Add more incidents to the homepage + the ability to cycle through the lower effort ones if you run out?

Quality of life:
- Shared validation rules to reject em dashes, semi-colons outside of code blocks, etc. Tiny shit that it often misses.
- Validation to cut out widows and orphans on desktop -- i.e., character count validations at the prompt level.
- Edit messages + Regenerate button (soft delete everything >= created_at of the message you want to regen from)
- Make certain technical phrases clickable, and link to an article convo
- Stop showing a blank conversation when you use the back button.
- Figure out why it sometimes just dies. OpenAI upstream issues? Add a "Hey, this is awkward. Put in your email to continue later." or something.
- Show multiple choice options in persisted conversation -- can't just generate in JS -- MessageElement, maybe?
- Figure out why auditing doesn't work
- Login to support@ + jacob@ on your phone just in case.

Email:
- Audit what needs to be ported over once you eventually transition back into the paid version (e.g., multiple choice, article links, etc).
- Make it possible to clone a conversation into a separate web-based fork. Don't try to maintain two channels in a single conversation.
- Make sure to add the resubscribe link in the final "We're auto-unsubscribing you" email. -- and maybe actually send one?
- After first contract, pay ~$1k for a verified checkmark in Gmail -- VMC - Verified Mark Certificate, like Verisign for logos. Need a custom trademarked logo too.
- Add an email after auto-delete of data, but somebody replies to a super old thread -- "Sorry, I might have auto-deleted that conversation after 3 months of inactivity. <Want to start a new one? Type 1. for secrets management 2. for something else 3. for whatever"

Paid Version:
- Monthly email report format to Directors. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Additional tracks? Security, GRC, etc.

Not Super Important:
----------------------
- Cancel try-replicate + Apollo billing. Zero traction from cold email + feels spammy. Seeing traction from ads. Lean in.
- Carousel screenshots for conversations + code snippets
- YouTube video
- Check conversation scrolling on mobile -- doing it too early?
- First name in coaching loop emails if known? Only do that for Contact, not Member?
- Double check all your plans for overcharging (e.g., Apollo, Postmark, etc)
- Add more incidents. You have 6 weeks total (really 5 -- initial + 5 weeks)
- Don't send weekly emails to people who bounced. Bounce check on cold, not on transactional? - Postmark does this automatically?
- Handle email throttling for abuse
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Create a procurement PDF you can link to in your "Welcome to replicate.info!" email?
- Automated data deletion + audit logging
