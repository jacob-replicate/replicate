Paid Version:
- Monthly email report format for leadership. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Customization of prompts the team uses. Team reports for tech leads + EMs + the team at large. Reports are never bad. Green or yellow, never red.
- Conversation sharing. -- "This tripped me up. Share the insight in my team's feed, with a link to the full convo if they're curious."
- Shared weekly drills so everyone is on the same page. Make it part of the UI itself. It should be the default.
- Team-wide blind spot insights.
- Additional tracks? Security, GRC, Go, etc.
- You need to make logging in as a free user enticing. Once they're logged in (e.g., to view their growth + personalized incidents), it's easier to get EM onboard.
- IAM + GRC for data/access controls. Public/free site, but you're still typing your data into it.
-------------

- 7 day cache for coaching_intro response + cron job to hydrate
- Dig into why Turn 1 is failing validation a ton.
- Clean up "question_format" for turn 2. You're giving inconsistent instructions in the "reply =" line. Fill the CTA context with that turn 2 instruction.
- Turn 4: Multiple choice, but only if short answer? Long answer implies they're ready to type?
- Stop scroling to the top of the last message when you send a new one. Scroll to the actual bottom of the page then.
- Stop IP banning scrapers, just malicious rate limits.
- Make 4th question not super hard yet. You just transitioned off the first text 1v1 question. Needs to still be light.
- Better error handling + retries. Don't just let the loop die.
- Share button
- Don't ask yes/no CTA if you're showing multiple choice (or hide the options temporarily)
- More explanatory content for juniors -> mids. More multiple choice thrown in. Yes or no questions. Coaching prompts. GPT-style "Want to learn about X?" messages.
- Reddit ad for "SEV-1: MultiXact pressure is stalling the primary database" -- just open with the SEV, not what the site is
- Timer improvements. "New SEV" / "Keep Going" / Invite your friends to this one
- Mobile conversations. Shorter paragraphs, shortr file namees (service on newline, not # character)
- Meta tags + sharing images/text

- Make sure long messages naturally have more...
    - Code blocks + telemetry
    - Declarative paragraphs without questions. Just feedback on the previous thought.
    - More explanations + nudges to ask for a hint.
    - Do a "pulse check" every 8 messages? Adjust accordingly?
    - Figure this out dynamically, don't just base it off turn count.

- Max length on input box to prevent lazy copy/pastes burning tokens?
- Make article_intro use the base class's call method. Make starting_batch_size a method, don't make it overwrite the call method.
- "Want to see how your friends will do? <This link> will send them a fresh copy of the same SEV."
- Follow up with additional messages like 30 seconds in. Keep them hooked. Thinking hard? Great, I'm typing now at random to anthropomorphize the AI.
- Remove the subheader suffix whenever you answer a question (coaching_intro, or any article reply). The big bold subheader should go.
- Put user agent on BannedIp table + add better logging.
- a11y

- Action Bar - Make the CTAs more visible
    - Give me a hint
    - Write me an article
    - View incident library
    - Switch difficulty
    - Share with friends / export screenshot
    - Fix a new SEV
    - Timer
    - End incident + teach me the lesson (i.e., print an article -> make coaching return an ArticleReply if needed).

- Mid-conversation Nudges
    - Make this way more visual. 1920x1080 thumbnails with tags (redis, k8s, linux, etc)
    - Accordions (Roblox/Fortnite style) that hug the edges of the window with a separate background color. Horizontal scroll through topics.

- Incident library. Get them browsing for more content. Add key article convos into the list. Dark mode on the homepage so it doesn't blend in?
- Periodic progress reports throughout the conversation. Visual.
- Add a "change difficulty" nudge in the conversation?

Security / Ops
- Keep a pool of pre-generated conversation intros to reduce AI cost, speed up loading, and lower risk of people spamming your homepage and racking up LLM bills.
- Add reason to IP bans.
- Cloudflare

- New elements:
    - QOL: New script to judge the conversation so far, and figure out which elements from the list below to include. Don't clog up the prompt with all the instructions.
    - What kind of elements would land hard with returning users?
        - Want to use this at work? Send this tl;dr to whoever leads the team.
        - Welcome back. What skills are we working on today?

    - Single article highlight (show the first paragraph, faded -- not a title + description)

    - Diff view to highlight PR changes
        - https://github.com/rtfpessoa/diff2html?tab=readme-ov-file#online-example

    - Table (e.g. config diffs, replica status, customer impact matrix)

    - Timeline (e.g. event order, deployment propagation)
        - This is just a text summary. You don't need a fancy JS library.

    - Bar Chart (e.g. per-zone errors, API versions in use)
        - https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=bar-simple

    - Scatterplot (e.g. latency vs correctness, node drift)
        - https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=scatter-simple

    - Heatmap (e.g. fault intensity across services or zones)
        - https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=heatmap-cartesian

    - Sequence Diagram (e.g. write flow across services)
    - Cards -- show some text, and it flips to other text whenever you click on it
    - Flow charts
    - "Edit this SQL" to run commands. GPT just makes shit up based on what they type.
    - Group chat transcripts - "where's the flaw in their thinking here?"
    - Share this SEV with your friends link (replicate.info/retry-storm)

Quality of life:
- Fix missing "Loading..." after articles load for "What am I missing here?" prompt.
- Shared validation rules to reject em dashes, semi-colons outside of code blocks, etc. Tiny shit that it often misses.
- Gsub out ’ characters
- Edit messages + Regenerate button (soft delete everything >= created_at of the message you want to regen from)
- Make certain technical phrases clickable, and link to an article convo
- Stop showing a blank conversation when you use the back button.
- Figure out why it sometimes just dies. OpenAI upstream issues? Add a "Hey, this is awkward. Put in your email to continue later." or something.
- Show multiple choice options in persisted conversation -- can't just generate in JS -- MessageElement, maybe?
- Figure out why auditing doesn't work


Email:
- Audit what needs to be ported over once you eventually transition back into the paid version (e.g., multiple choice, article links, etc).
- Make it possible to clone a conversation into a separate web-based fork. Don't try to maintain two channels in a single conversation.
- Make sure to add the resubscribe link in the final "We're auto-unsubscribing you" email. -- and maybe actually send one?
- After first contract, pay ~$1k for a verified checkmark in Gmail -- VMC - Verified Mark Certificate, like Verisign for logos. Need a custom trademarked logo too.
- Add an email after auto-delete of data, but somebody replies to a super old thread -- "Sorry, I might have auto-deleted that conversation after 3 months of inactivity. <Want to start a new one? Type 1. for secrets management 2. for something else 3. for whatever"

Not Super Important:
----------------------
- Cancel try-replicate + Apollo billing. Zero traction from cold email + feels spammy. Seeing traction from ads. Lean in.
- Carousel screenshots for conversations + code snippets
- YouTube video
- Check conversation scrolling on mobile -- doing it too early?
- First name in coaching loop emails if known? Only do that for Contact, not Member?
- Double check all your plans for overcharging (e.g., Apollo, Postmark, etc)
- Add more incidents. You have 6 weeks total (really 5 -- initial + 5 weeks)
- Don't send weekly emails to people who bounced. Bounce check on cold, not on transactional? - Postmark does this automatically?
- Handle email throttling for abuse
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Create a procurement PDF you can link to in your "Welcome to replicate.info!" email?
- Automated data deletion + audit logging
