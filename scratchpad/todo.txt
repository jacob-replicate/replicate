------- LAUNCH ----------


Product

- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
- GPT 5 (in email, at least, not on web where it's slow af)

Ops
- Move Missive to Mercury account
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Cron job to filter inbox + draft replies
- Figure out when bills land in Mercury account, so you can fund the account on time.
- Double check Apollo invoicing + Mercury card transition
- Find Apollo payment receipt + brainstorm any vendors you missed. Double check for all invoices.
- Auth0 + SCIM + Self-serve admin UI
- How will you know if your Bouncer credits are almost up?

Sales
- "I want the weekly emails too" checkbox on trial form -- lots of VP's won't give a fuck
- Create a procurement PDF you can link to in your "Welcome to replicate.info!" email?
- Monthly email report format to Directors. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Bouncer API call on owner email with loading spinner
- Marketing newsletter. Just drop them into the typical queue. 3-week pause, with a Slack link for their team?
- Add an example URL to copy/paste in the "Not the right time?" box. Give them the value ASAP.
- Set up process for cold email addresses that failed bounce check. Funnel bad data into a CSV that Fiverr can clean up + send back.
- Upsert contact metadata, so you can keep track of job changes. DB is going to get stale otherwise.

Reliability
- Sentry
- PagerDuty (or alternative, maybe, so you don't mix with Hashi? Sentry app, maybe?)
- APM? Librato equivalent?
- Add auto-unsubscribe logic (check it at runtime to account for last-minute messages)
- Bounce webhook reporting

Security
- Automated data deletion + audit logging
- After first contract, pay ~$1k for a verified checkmark in Gmail -- VMC - Verified Mark Certificate, like Verisign for logos
