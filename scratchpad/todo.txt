- Cron job to start monday email loops

Ops
- Move Missive to Mercury account
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Cron job to filter inbox + draft replies
- Figure out when bills land in Mercury account, so you can fund the account on time.
- Double check Apollo invoicing + Mercury card transition
- Find Apollo payment receipt.

Sales
- Upsert contact metadata, so you can keep track of job changes. DB is going to get stale otherwise.
- Monthly email report format to Directors. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Add an example URL to copy/paste in the "Not the right time?" box. Give them the value ASAP.
- Set up process for cold email addresses that failed bounce check. Funnel bad data into a CSV that Fiverr can clean up + send back.

Reliability
- Add auto-unsubscribe logic (check it at runtime to account for last-minute messages)
- Bounce webhook reporting

Security
- Automated data deletion + audit logging

Product
- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
- GPT 5 (in email, at least, not on web where it's slow af)
- :coaching_should_continue prompt -- uncomment guard clause in coaching message generator

- Marketing newsletter. Just drop them into the typical queue. 3-week pause, with a Slack link for their team.
  - Just drop them into the normal rotation for awhile. Then gradually pull it away with a stronger upsell nudge in the footers.
  - They still have to copy/paste the links in Slack (e.g., replicate.info/retry-storm) to their team.

- Move payments to Mercury account, not personal card.
