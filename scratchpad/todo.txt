- Your decisions can spawn new incidents, as an integrated way to break off into new experiences + surface novelty by design.
    - "Hey, just crossposting #inc-5938"... - Put a tab bar in the toolbar to switch between incidents at the top + send notifications in popup that are interesting

- Team mode lets you play async and solve the problem together. Switch between different categories. Escape the room style team building. Solo is free. Team mode is like daily chess.
- Invite your team -> share link -> "Jeff joined (with avatar)"
- If multiplayer, leave old decisions lingering + leave an X to close them out. Still relevant.
    - Ask LLM to generate chat message live (so old chat messags don't get stale -- the multi choice prompt provides context, not an actual message)

- GitHub recent PR links.

- Click "New SEV" button. Show a new one ASAP, along with a link to browser after it reloads. Amazon "one click buy"
- Better sharing text in navbar when you click on links. Has generic "Check out this incident" text now.
- IBM disclosure. Make sure to update the dates on your terms/privacy/security pages to be recent.
- Make incident generation intents align with your old INCIDENTS constant format.
- Rerender the multiple choice questions on page reload + back button
- Merge progress with existing account after logging in
- Make sure you're returning to old convos in static/index. You're forking every time, which is bad.
- Make the conversation descriptions closer to incidents, not invariants?
- Review the list of topics again. Do they all align with incident-focused conversations in V1?
- Add another engineer during a handoff. Hey Jacob, I can take this one over. Want to try another incident?
- Replace the navbar filesystem breadcrumbs. Not as relevant anymore. Make a callout to other incidents somehow.
- Meta tags + sharing images/text
- "Generating" spinner in category list when topics are generating.
- Fire logo emoji next to conversation title/description (to make room for different icons for design review, articles, etc)
- Add language tags (e.g., "Go", "Python", etc) to the conversations
- Better error handling + retries. Don't just let the loop die.
- Cancel try-replicate + Apollo billing. Zero traction from cold email + feels spammy. Seeing traction from ads. Lean in.
- Cut article variant completely
- Let people edit/delete messages
- Stop showing a blank conversation when you use the back button -- did that one JS change you made for navigation links persist?
- Cloudflare
- Convert conversations/show to React
- Show multiple choice options in persisted conversation -- can't just generate in JS -- MessageElement, maybe?
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys, or just delete it?
- If still a thing, disable all radio button on clicks when sending message. You can click give me a hint + answer old radios.
