- Remove bold text from web conversations
- Maybe make cold unsubscribe a confirmation box? Why stop yourself from hitting people again in a few months?
- New "first email" link
- Add "Give me a hint" to coaching emails too?

- First name in coaching loop emails if known? Only do that for Contact, not Member?
- .shuffle.pop through subject lines to guarantee uniqueness?
- Remove the newline between tech_explanation -> CTA in cold email.
- Terms + Privacy + MSA/DPA review
- Double check all your plans for overcharging (e.g., Apollo, Postmark, etc)
- Add more incidents. You have 6 weeks total (really 5 -- initial + 5 weeks)
- Cron job to filter inbox + draft replies
- Make sure to add the resubscribe link in the final "We're auto-unsubscribing you" email.
- Don't send weekly emails to people who bounced. Bounce check on cold, not on transactional? - Postmark does this automatically?
- Attach PDF's + inline JPG's once they close the loop
- GPT 5 (in email, at least, not on web where it's slow af)
- :coaching_should_continue prompt -- uncomment guard clause in coaching message generator
- Handle email throttling for abuse
- Figure out how to figure out in Postmark's UI if emails bounced, so you can manually flag + notify the account owner.
- Move Missive to Mercury account
- Protect your S3 credentials from misuse -- spin down old keys
- Figure out when bills land in Mercury account, so you can fund the account on time.
- Double check Apollo invoicing + Mercury card transition
- Find Apollo payment receipt from late August (~$59) + brainstorm any vendors you missed. Double check for all invoices.
- How will you know if your Bouncer credits are almost up?
- Add a "check your spam folder" message to the homepage after you submit the form
- Create a procurement PDF you can link to in your "Welcome to replicate.info!" email?
- Monthly email report format to Directors. Make it a PDF that Rails renders, which you can attach in Postmark email, that they can forward to VP.
- Bouncer API call on owner email with loading spinner
- Accordion left/right links floated around the homepage conversation.
- PagerDuty (or alternative, maybe, so you don't mix with Hashi? Sentry app, maybe?)
- Automated data deletion + audit logging
- After first contract, pay ~$1k for a verified checkmark in Gmail -- VMC - Verified Mark Certificate, like Verisign for logos. Need a custom trademarked logo too.
- Synthetic checks to verify homepage is still up
- Add an email after auto-delete of data, but somebody replies to a super old thread -- "Sorry, I might have auto-deleted that conversation after 3 months of inactivity. <Want to start a new one? Type 1. for secrets management 2. for something else 3. for whatever"
- Test for Prompts::CoachingIntro (since it has custom logic - might find some to cut)
