- "Okay, I get it. Next." button
- Rename "coaching" conversation to "incident" message generator. It's one way to teach a concept, not the only way.
- Indigo breadcrumb bar at top of conversation whenever you navigate away from experience.
- "You can send replicate.info/raft to your friends. They'll get a fresh copy." - White on indigo footer, always.

Element
    belongs_to :page
    belongs_to :element, optional: true

Experience
    - url_code - replicate.info/raft
    - state - :published, :archived
    - session_id
    - tags - text[] (i.e., "text" with array: true in create_table call)

    def fork(session_id)
        ActiveRecord::Transaction.base do
            new_experiecne = self.dup
            new_experience.template = false
            new_experience.session_id = session_id

        Element
        - type
            - Maybe actually use STI? Each element has a .fork method too that takes a principal + handles recursion?
            - If forking a QuestionTemplate, create a new Conversation + link it. If creating an Incident, create a new Incident? Render each differently?
        - context
        - belongs_to :experience
        - belongs_to :element, optional: true
        - belongs_to :conversation
        - has_many :elements

        - Element.new(type: "Text", context: { body: "In a distributed system, leader election is the process by which..." })
        - Element.new(type: "Section", context: { name: "Leader Election" })
            - Element.new(type: "ConversationTemplate", element: section, context: { conversation_type: "XYZ" }) -- somehow mark that it's a yes/no question, so you don't create 3 answers for it
            - Element.new(type: "ConversationTemplate", element: section) -- these probably shouldn't be conversations. Element.new(type: "ConversationStarter")
            - Convert to "Conversation" during experience.fork(current_session)

        - Element.new(type: "IncidentTemplate", context: { call_to_action: "Begin SEV" })

    Future versions
        - organization_id
        - principal_id + principal_type (one day - org, team, user -- not just one person)
        - public
        - required_by -- i.e., end of quarter date for compliance

Conversation
    - Make it parent_id + parent_type, not referring_conversation_id
