I'm working on a side project for engineers. replicate.info sharpens how you think about risk in complex, distributed systems.
GPT asks hard infra/sec questions until you mess up, and helps fill in the gaps.
It covers topics like DNS, multi-region failover, leader election, AuthZ, consistency guarantees, etc.
100% free. Takes ~30 hours to finish. Think: pop quiz that cuts through hand waving, not a course you read on auto-pilot.
